         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now my deare Children, I beſeech you in the Name of God (and I hope your heavenly Father) to labour to maintaine the life and heate of love, unity, Amity, ſweet Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Concord betweene your ſelves. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider for this purpoſe, that it is a ſpeciall duty God requires of you all to be performed each to other, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. And the Lord hates and abominates ſuch as low diſcord between Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.24. And well worth your obſervation for your encouragement to performe this duty here urged, is that which the Spirit of God laies downe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>how good and how pleaſant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity,</hi> which in the remaining verſes is amplified by two choice ſimilitudes, and with a comfortable concluſion. Nature hath Characterized this ſo ſtrongly upon the hearts of Men, that ſome have taken revenge upon ſuch as have done wrong to Brethren or Siſters. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> ſlew all the Inhabitants of a whole City for the wrong that <hi>Shechem</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hamor</hi> had done to their Siſter <hi>Dinah, Gen.</hi> 34.25, 26, 27, 31. <hi>Gideon</hi> put <hi>Zebah</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> to death for their ſlaying his Brethren, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.19, 21. <hi>Abner</hi> ſlew <hi>Aſahel</hi> the Brother of <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.23. but <hi>Joab</hi> ſlayes <hi>Abner</hi> for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Amnon</hi> deflowrs <hi>Tamar</hi> the

ſiſter of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.14. but <hi>Abſalom</hi> did cauſe him to loſe his life for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. Now theſe things (my deare Children) I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to put you upon ſuch courſes, for they were Acts of murther in thoſe that did them, and that in a high degree, and you have not, nor cannot have any warrant to do ſuch vile things; all you can do in ſuch caſes is to go to God by prayer, and to the Civill Magiſtrate by complaint for the ſecurity of each one of you. But I make uſe of theſe Inſtances to convince you, that if you love not one another you ſin even againſt Nature, how much more then againſt God. And truly, you ſin alſo againſt your ſelves, for by unbrotherly breaches you weaken your owne ſtrength; The uniting of Brethren and Siſters together by love fortifies them againſt the danger of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. The earth will with more eaſe ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up one ſingle drop of water than many drops and buckets-full met together in one. A threefold Cord is not quickly broken. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.12. Moſt excellent to this purpoſe is the ſtory of the old dying man, who having many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and deſiring they might be all united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in love, he was ambitious to leave ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon their hearts and ſpirits as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion not eaſily to be forgotten, but that might remaine for the end beforeſaid: Who having them all preſent before him, cals for a ſheafe of Arrowes, which when brought he gives to divers of his Children a ſingle Arrow and bids them break them, which with great
<pb facs="tcp:62199:8"/>
caſe they did: But then he takes all the reſt of them and with a cord he binds them in one bundle, and then bids them breake them if they could, which they aſlaying to do could not ſo much as bend them. Then he applies himſelfe to them by way of counſell, and tels them, that if they were divided one from another in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they would expoſe themſelves to ruine: But if they were all firmely conjoyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one, they might be able to preſerve themſelves, and one another. (Ah) my deare hearts, it is the deſire and prayer of your poore Father for you unto the Bleſſed, and for ever bleſſed Trinity, who are three in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and but one in Eſſence, that you all might have but one heart, and one ſoule in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation one to another, that thereby God might be glorified, others edified, and your ſelves for ever comforted by your mutuall love, and ſweet deportment one to another.</p>
            <p>Thus, my much endeared Children, I have laboured to give you an Epitome of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duties you owe unto God, to his Church, and to your own ſoules and bodies. Now to all the advice I have given you in particular, I ſhall in the Apoſtles owne words adde this in generall, only changing the Appellation; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally my Children, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; If there be any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and if there be any praiſe, thinke on theſe
<pb facs="tcp:62199:8"/>
things; And the God of peace ſhall be with you, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. and the latter end of <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Now my deare Children, becauſe I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is the duty of a Father to ſeeke the compleat happineſſe of his Children, both Internall and Externall, and though chiefly the good of their ſoules, in relation to a better life: Yet in a ſecond place, the good alſo of their bodies, and their outward comfortable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this Terreſtiall World. I cannot therefore omit, in order to your well-being here, to communicate unto you ſome adviſe, in reference to the change of your conditions by Marriage, if the Lord be pleaſed to bring you to ſuch a time for ſeaſonableneſſe, and to give you opportunities to embrace the ſame; Let me tell you, that for you to enjoy meet helpers in that eſtate, you may reckon to be one of the greateſt out ward favours that God doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on his Children to ſweeten their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion otherwiſe mixt with divers Afflictions in this life. But in the diſcharge of this laſt duty I ſhall be very conciſe, becauſe you may meet with variety of directions this way in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing lines, and body of the diſcourſe, all which I beſeech you to mind in your reading of them, and much more in your practice in walking up to them; but I ſhall here take the liberty to adde in generall this one thing, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it is a Rule, Caſe, and Maxime in Divinity, that whatſoever Action any one is call'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, which is of high concernment, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Gods glory,) and relates to the good
<pb facs="tcp:62199:9"/>
of man, and but once (in probability) to be done in his whole life, and which being done is unalterable, and remaines like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians, Dan.</hi> 5.8.12. There is required more than ordinary caution and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in the undertaking and managing of the ſame. Now the entring into the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Eſtate is an Action of the ſame nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſt; nay, to ſpeake properly, it is that Action, and none but it that fully anſwers the deſcription beforeſaid; And if ſo, then judge you what ſingular care ſhould fill your hearts and heads when you mind Marriage, and uſe the meanes conducible for that end.</p>
            <p>Deare hearts, I cannot but thinke it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to acquaint you concerning this poore piece enſuing, which is denominated <hi>Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Counſell,</hi> that the Originall Copy of it was compil'd ſixe and twenty yeares ſince, which being then brought into a compendious way, (and truly it is little more now) I did preſent it, not only to very intelligible private Chriſtians, but to three very Orthodoxe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines for their Approbation of it, (it being then in my intentions to make it publique,) which approbation of theirs I had, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell from one of them to print the Booke, who did alſo put me in a faire way to accompliſh the ſame, and it had been extant, but that thoſe times did obſtruct it, ſince which time it hath laine even as dead and buried; But (my choiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved ones,) Now God having (in the riches of his grace) beſtowed you on me, (who
<pb facs="tcp:62199:9"/>
are as deare to me as my own ſoule,) what could I do leſſe than ſeeke your compleat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe? And I apprehending this poore work might contribut a ſmall mite thereto (by the bleſſing of God) I could not be ſo unjuſt to detaine it from you. Truly, (next the ſeeking the glory of God) I have chiefly for your ſakes made it obvious to publike view; I muſt confeſſe, the good of all poore ſoules I deſire to prize; and if any receive benefit by this my poore paines, I deſire to take it as a very large engagement to my poore ſoule to praiſe the Lord for his infinite goodneſſe and grace here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; Further I muſt acquaint you, that I have in ſome things altered this from the firſt Copy, and I hope it is not for the worſt, but for the better; And now my poore hearts, on whom can I ſo properly beſtow it as on you, who are bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh? I have two ſpeciall reaſons, amongſt many, to write this Epiſtle Dedicatory to you: Firſt, to manifeſt my Cordiall love to your ſoules. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that hereby I may oblige you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare it the more, and to make it your Rule to walke by.</p>
            <p>Now if either you or any others ſhould marvell I ſhould make my ſelfe ſo pupiller as to make uſe of your names at the beginning, and my owne at the end of this Epiſtle: And ſecondly, that I ſhould affix my Effigies at the Front of this Booke, to both I ſhall give a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did anſwer. But firſt I muſt tell you, that it was not to gaine popular applauſe; for firſt, I
<pb facs="tcp:62199:10"/>
know nothing in it that can advance ſo courſe an end. Secondly, I do profeſſe I deſire with my ſoule to abominate all popularity: I can with much comfort averre that my ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is to avoid it, for nothing is more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my mind than to ſet ſo much as halfe a foot on the ſtage of this world. But to give you a briefe, but reall poſitive anſwer of the firſt, It was that it might take the deeper, and more kindly impreſſion on the hearts of you my poore Children, that you may looke on all contained both in this Epiſtle, and in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe as the Counſell of your own deare Father. That you may ſay, this Counſell, theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, theſe reproofes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were directed to us from our Father, and they were all evidences that we were deare to him, and we plainely ſee he loved our poore ſoules, which I hope (by the grace of God) will be to you as a ſpur to quicken you to practice all. But for my Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, I have deſired that ſhould ſtand in the place beforeſaid, to be a meanes to preſerve the memory of my ſelfe alwaies freſh upon your hearts who are my Children. For I am not aſhamed to confeſſe (if it were before all the world) that I deſire my Children in yeares to come (if God ſee it good) may be able to take notice what kind of man their Father was even in perſon; I care not who bury me in oblivion ſo my Children do not; But theſe things being only circumſtantials, let them paſſe without more ſaid to them.</p>
            <p>Now if you (my deare Children,) or any
<pb facs="tcp:62199:10"/>
other ſhould be unſatisfied in relation to the uncouth Method of the following directions in reference to the duties of Superiours and Inferiours each to others, it being contrary to the order, not only of the way of all Elaborate Writers on ſuch a Subject, but alſo to the way of the Holy Ghoſt, to lay down the duties of Superiours in the firſt place, and then of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. I deſire to paſſe this account for it; You may be pleaſed to mind what is my chiefe aime in the foreſaid diſcourſe, Truly, it is to provoke ſuch as deſire to enter into the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age eſtate, not only to mind their Call unto the ſame, and to informe them in the way they muſt walke in, and the meanes they muſt uſe tending to atchieving their deſires, but alſo to put them upon an earneſt endeavour to be acquainted with the duties that their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will then be bound to the performance of. Now it is clearely neceſſary, that every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man ſhould firſt learne what his own duties are that he may diſcharge them; and then the duties of others, that within his place and Calling he muſt teach, and ſtir them up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame, <hi>Thou that teachest another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? Rom.</hi> 2.21. He that reproveth another had need to be unreprova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our Saviour teacheth as much, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7 3.</p>
            <p>Much endeared Children, you cannot but remember that I have acquainted you, that I cannot but conceive my abode here with you is ſhort, and I may truly ſay, my deſire is to depart this life and to be with Chriſt, which
<pb facs="tcp:62199:11"/>
for me is beſt of all, yet to remaine in the fleſh is more profitable for you, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23, 24. But however the Lord be pleaſed to deale with me I hope your Mother will diſcharge her duties toward you both for ſoule and body, and will endeavour to walke before you in good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and that may prove to you all matter of joy and ſingular comfort.</p>
            <p>But you my deare Son, I muſt here take the liberty to tell you, (and I cannot do leſſe,) that you are deſcended from the Loynes of a moſt choice and precious Mother (who by divine providence loſt her naturall life in being a meanes to bring you forth to live in this World.) Truly, I might here dip a golden Pen in Odoriferous Oyle, and therewith write an Encomium of her, both of her life, and of her death. She was indeed a <hi>Margaret</hi> by Name, and much more by ſweetneſſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; But above all, by the ſuper-abundant grace of God toward her, and in her, ſhe was of a moſt tranſcendent, exemplary, and holy life. She did (through the grace of God) walke ſweetly with her Saviour in all pious waies; ſhe did highly prize the meanes of grace; She did really hold forth the power of godlineſſe in an unblameable Converſation; She was frequent in ſecret prayer; and let me tell you (to your comfort) ſhe hath lodg'd in the boſome of God (by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, and in the Mediation of her deare Saviour) many an ardent and moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prayer for your poore ſoule while ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:62199:11"/>
was here in the fleſh; which I doubt not but the Lord will returne anſwer of (through his free grace) upon your head and heart, upon your body and upon your ſoule. She was full of the overflowings of love to her moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy (yet much endeared) Conſort. She was of a very peaceable and amiable life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all perſons. She did live much in a little time; And as ſhe was of an exact life (in compariſon of moſt,) ſo through the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace of God) ſhe ended her daies in the peace of a good conſcience, and did enjoy peace with God which paſſeth underſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37.37. God gave her the white ſtone, and therein the new Name written, which none knew but her ſelfe who received it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. She was full of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Raptures, and Divine manifeſtations of the love of God to her ſoule on her death-bed. She went not out by death like the ſnuffe of a ſtinking Candle, leaving an ill ſavour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, but like Jumper, or the choiceſt ſweet Perfumes. Dyed <hi>Abner</hi> as a foole? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.33. No. Or dyed this precious Chriſtian as a Daughter of <hi>Belial?</hi> No. (The thoughts thereof in the leaſt meaſure is to be abhorr'd with a kind of infinite deteſtation;) it may be truly affirmed, that ſhe lived like a Saint, and dyed like a Daughter of the moſt High God. To her to live was Chriſt, and her death was her gaine, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. And to her infinite gaine ſhe hath found it, for ſhe doth now reſt in the boſome of her ſweet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:62199:12"/>
Saviour, and ſhall to all Eternity. I dare not ſay, many Daughters have done vertuouſly, and that this glorious Saint hath excell'd them all, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.29. But this I will be bold to ſay, that though many Daughters have done ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, yet that not one of them did ever excell her. I could do no leſſe than preſent you my deare Son with the knowledge of theſe things, both for your Imitation, and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſince Divine providence hath given me ſuch an opportunity as this, to atteſt before all the World the reall ſuper-eminency of ſuch a Saint, ſo nearely related to you my Son, much more to me, I darſt not omit it; certainely if the Righteous ſhould be had in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12.6. it muſt be then as much my duty to endeavour it as the duty of any: Nay more my duty, in reference to this glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul, than the duty of any other in the world.</p>
            <p>My very deare and choicely beloved Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I have been ſomewhat longer in this Epiſtle Dedicatory than I intended at the firſt, but the ſtrength of my Affections to your ſouls hath carried me forth in this way. Truly, the good of thoſe precious ſoules of yours I deſire to ſeek as the good of my own. I know to my griefe and ſorrow that there hath been a world of evill infuſed into your whole man by, and from me. (O) that God would honour me in making me an inſtrument under his bleſſed ſelfe of plucking you out of the mire of your corruptions, <hi>Iude ver.</hi> 23. And God doth know that in all theſe lines I have had an aime, and
<pb facs="tcp:62199:12"/>
very ardent deſires and ſincere endeavours to contribute ſomething this way. But to draw toward a cloſe let me ſay (in ſome ſenſe) as <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 22.20 I have written to you excellent things in Counſell and Knowledge, yet not as they flow from me, (for out of me who am but an empty and darke creature can no ſuch things come,) but as God hath enabled me (through his grace) to gather them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſo many precious flowers ſpringing in the Garden of his own word. Deare hearts, it is ſaid of <hi>Abel,</hi> that <hi>whilſt he is dead he yet ſpeaketh, Heb.</hi> 11.4. (Ah) let me tell you, that by theſe lines of mine I ſhall ſpeake to you when I ſhall have no eares to heare you, nor eyes to ſee you. Now I beſeech you for the Lords ſake, and for your precious ſoules ſake, that you would ſeriouſly mind what I have preſented to you, and be carefull to practice the ſame, and whatſoever elſe the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to provide for your inſtruction to further you in a holy life; for elſe let me plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you, that theſe eyes of mine ſhall ſee you, and theſe eares of mine ſhall hear you arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſentenced, and condemned at the Bar of Gods Tribunall Seat to everlaſting perdition from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. And then I ſhall want an heart to mourn over you. And yet if not only my ſelfe, but men and Angels ſhould melt away by teares of ſorrow unto nothing in ſympathizing and condoling your moſt exceeding ſad and dolorous conditions, it
<pb facs="tcp:62199:13"/>
could not contribute to eaſe you of ſo much as one ſigh, ſob groane, or cry unto Eternity. (Ah) my poore ſoule, ſhall it ever be ſaid that I have begotten Children to be made Companions for Devils. (Ah, Deare God I beſeech thee for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake forbid it.) But I bleſſe God I hope better things of you (my ſweet Children,) and ſuch as concerne ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though I thus ſpeake, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9.

But if the Lord ſhall be graciouſly pleaſed to adde a ſpan of time to my daies here, I truſt he will give me a tender heart towards you, and that (through his abundant grace) I ſhall labour to improve time, gifts, and opportunities, to ſeek by all meanes (and in ſpeciall by humble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and earneſt prayers to the God of all grace to give you all all-ſaving grace) your reall Tranquillity, and true felicity here, (and ſo grant me to ſee reall and royall demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his free grace upon, and in your ſoules, diſcovering on your hearts, and in your lives the ſpots of his Children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5.)

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62199:16"/>Madam, In that God hath been pleaſed to be ſo gracious to you as to keepe you from defiling your garments by walking in by-waies; It is a very cleare demonſtration that the ground-work of your Profeſſion hath been laid on the Rock of Ages. And hence it is that your ſtructure ſtands firme and unſhaken in theſe ſtormy times of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of opinions (eſpecially in relation to fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall truths, (for in points meerely circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Chriſtians ought to beare one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to be disjoyn'd in affections to each other, they agreeing in the maine. And hence it is in the firſt place, that I have gathered up ſome encouragement to preſume thus upon your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by this bold Intruſion. But</p>

But that this preſumption of mine may (even in the leaſt meaſure) be eſteemed of to ſuch an end it only reſts in your Ladiſhips Candid Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Which Acceptation of Yours I moſt humbly beg, for without it I am at an exceeding great ſtand in this particular.</p>
            <p>Madam, be pleaſed therefore I beſeech you ſo far to deny your ſelfe as to caſt a favourable aſpect upon this poore enſuing peece, which (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) will be ſome ſupportation to it; for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a weake and poore Babe.

ſelfe? Yet God can make this foreſaid Babe a fruitfull Mother of many Children in this our Iſrael, who may both bleſſe the Lord for it, and for your ſelfe, worthy Madam, for accepting, and to your power Patronizing the ſame.</p>

            <p>Marriage we ſay is an holy Ordinance of God, and if it were entred into according to Divine directions, and uſed in a holy manner, it would be (as we may ſay) a Heaven upon Earth, full of all outward joy; Nay, an help (being ſanctified of God) to further us in the way to the fruition of glory in Heaven hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

from lying as a burthen on others, that place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. the latter end of the 17. verſe may be applicable here: <hi>Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men;</hi> He that doth not provide for his own, eſpecially ſuch as are of his own Family, hath <hi>denied the faith, and is worſe than an Infidell,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Jacob</hi> tooke care for his own Family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.30.

But for anſwer, know, that if thy condition did run parallell with his, before, and at the time of Marriage, thou needſt take no great care before-hand; for, firſt his Father was exceeding rich, and had but two Children, (and no doubt but that <hi>Jacob</hi> had a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in due time of his Fathers eſtate, though the Holy Ghoſt mention no ſuch thing;) but ſecondly, <hi>Jacob</hi> married with a very wealthy Family, and his Father in Law had reaſon to maintaine him and his Charge, and that libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, when <hi>Iacob</hi> was no way ſpating in his great pains and care to encreaſe <hi>Labans</hi> eſtate, which indeed <hi>Laban</hi> himſelfe doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.27.

Take heed, be not inordinate, but eaſily denied of God; aske no outward things, but on condition God ſee it expedient to beſtow them, for if thou wilt not be denied, thou maieſt have the ſeeming ſweet meat, but the reall ſowre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt have fleſh, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.4, 5, 6. They cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without it; but they had it (as one well ſaid) with a vengeance, as appeares in the 31, 32, and 33. verſes of this Chapter. Laſtly, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to promote the worſhip of God to thy power, for elſe thy eſtate may be deplorable enough, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6. But if it ſhould be the good pleaſure of the Lord to exerciſe thee with ſeeming want, yet, if he be alſo pleaſed to ſanctifie ſuch a condition to thee, thou haſt that which is more then equivalent to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies in the world; Beloved, if thou canſt live upon God, and enjoy a holy conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in thy ſoule in the want of outward
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62199:29"/>
things thou art one of the richeſt men on this ſide Heaven, labour then, I ſay, to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, in and through Chriſt. Thus I hope I have put no diſcouragements on thee to ſtave thee off from taking the benefit and comfort of Marriage, for want of Lands or ſtock in any kind, but I rather deſire thee to take it, eſpecially if thou canſt not with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thy body, and ſafety to thy ſoul, containe thy ſelfe longer in the ſingle life, which brings me to the next particular, which is the ſecond demonſtration of a lawfull call to Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A ſecond and cleare ground for Marriage.</note>A ſecond, and cleare ground, demonſtrating a mans call to enter into the Marriage life, is, when the Lord is pleaſed to deny him the gift of chaſtity and continency (for the gift of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity is given of God, to whom he pleaſe, and when he pleaſe, and denied as he thinks fit) for when it is wanting, a man is diſabled to keep his ſoule and body for to be the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and for his reſidence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. being carried away with noyſome luſts, by beaſtly and impure affections: Now when thou art in this condition it is thy ſin if thou neglect any good opportunity to help thy ſelfe by entring into the ſtate of Marriage, for it is one kind of grieving the ſpirit, when he would make choiſe of thy body to live in, and thou doſt baracado up thy heart againſt him, by nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing uncleanneſſe in thee, whereby thou doſt invite the Devill to poſſeſſe thee, and doſt ſet open the doores of thy heart to receive him, to rule in thee, as in his own Vaſſall, to Gods
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62199:29"/>
diſhonour, and thy own ruine, it is time I ſay, for thee then to looke about thee, and to uſe that remedy which God hath ſanctified and appointed for thy ſpirituall and corporall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; <hi>To avoid Fornication let</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>every man have his own wife,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. it is better to marry than to burne by carnall Luſts, and fleſhly concupiſcence. This may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to informe thee of thy call to Marriage; firſt, by thy fitneſſe for that Eſtate; ſecondly, thy unfitneſſe for the ſingle life.</p>
            <p>It will in the next place be neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what ends thou muſt aime at in deſiring the marriage Eſtate, and they are three in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall; Firſt, the glory of God in the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Church. Secondly, The mortifying (not ſatisfying) thy own corruptions. Thirdly, The mutuall comfort which that Eſtate doth afford both to man and wife.</p>
            <p>The firſt and principall end every man is to aime at in his deſiring Marriage,<note place="margin">The firſt end of Marriage.</note> is (I ſay) Gods glory in the propagating of his Church; That there may be a certaine number of men and women to glorifie God by their holy lives unto the end of the world, which without Marriage cannot be expected. There may be (I confeſſe) an uncleane Generation of Men and Women to the end of Time without Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but the Lord would have a godly ſeed preſerved, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. Even ſuch a ſeed as may glorifie God in this life, and be everlaſtingly glorified in the world to come. If then the propagating of Gods Church ought to be the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62199:30"/>
chiefeſt thing we are to aime at in our deſiring the Eſtate of Marriage, (which neither Men nor Angels can deny) Then by the way, it may be a word of juſt reproofe to many Men and Women that are afraid of Marriage leſt they ſhould have Children; as alſo of divers who are married, that uſe all meanes poſſible to prevent great encreaſe of Children: But let theſe, both married, and unmarried, know, that they have a diabolicall ſpirit, they would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-worke God if poſſible, and fruſtrate his holy aimes by their impure principles; this their carriage (ſo far as they approve of it) doth evidently declare, they are wholly ſelf-ſeekers; but let them ſeeke for grounds of comfort where they can, I know not where, nor from whence they can expect it: And as for you who are married, and uſe meanes to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Lords own principall end in inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Marriage; I beſeech you ſeriouſly to mind the ſin, and puniſhment of a bird of your own feather, <hi>(viz) Onan, Gen.</hi> 38.9, 10. Now what if the Lord never ſince puniſhed the ſame ſin in the ſame kind, dare you conclude, that God hates not ſuch a ſin now as he then did? I dare more ſafely conclude, that God hates your groundleſſe preſumption, and were your eyes but open you might feare the Lord hath puniſhed you long ago with a heavy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, even with hardneſſe of heart, and wilfull Impenitency, which is far worſe than all temporall puniſhment in the world; (and doubtleſſe none can conclude infallibly that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62199:30"/>
               <hi>Onans</hi> puniſhment was more than temporall.) But ſome may perhaps ſay, We are not againſt having of Children, we much deſire to ſee the fruit of our own Bodies: But we are afraid indeed of having many, leſt we ſhould not be able to put bread into their mouths. Truly, let me tell thee, that if thy Children were created by thee, and ſo none of Gods Creatures, (take this as ſpoken only by way of ſuppoſition) there would no bread be found on Earth, nor Manna from Heaven, neither Terreſtriall, nor Celeſtial means to preſerve them from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and that immediately) both in their ſoules and bodies; for God would take no care for them, and thou couldſt take none: But poore ſoule I know, that thy Children being as much Gods Creatures as thy ſelfe, or as the Angels in Heaven, thou muſt labour (even in relation to thy Children) to have faith in God, as well in this caſe, as Chriſt exhorted his Diſciples in another, <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.22. God giveth the beaſt his food, and to the young Ravens when they cry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9. Naturaliſts do obſerve, that when the old Raven hath hatch'd her Eggs, and that the Young come forth, they being for ten daies covered with a kind of white downy feathers, the old one ownes them not, takes no paines to feed them till this white down be off and the black feathers put forth, and they ſay, that during thoſe ten daies (that the old one neglects them) the Lord feeds them with the influence of the Aire, but let that paſſe, we know God feeds not only the young Ravens,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62199:31"/>
but the old too; conſider further that God feeds the Fowles of the Aire, (that is, all the Fowles,) <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26. Read the place and mark the Inference by way of Interrogation; and Interrogations (we ſay) imply ſometimes the ſtrongeſt Negations: and ſometimes the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Affirmations, the laſt is here implied. God cloaths the Lillies of the field, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.28, 29, 30. pray mind the Inference there too; We ſometimes uſe a choice Proverbe, God never makes mouths but he provides meat; Oh that we could well improve this Proverb to a more full relying on God than we ever attain'd to, to this day. Beloved, let me tell you, you cannot diſtractingly care for your ſelves, or for your Children, but you queſtion either the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, or your Intereſt in him; Do you doubt whether God be Omnipotent, and ſo able to do you and yours good? Or his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe, or faithfulneſſe to performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? Truly, if you do you infinitely derogate from God, and much provoke him; Mind the ſin of the Iſraelites, can God prepare a Table in the Wilderneſſe? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.19, 20, 21. Mind alſo the ſad effects of this God-provoking ſin. Truly, I ſhall tell thee, (and I beſeech thee to conſider what I ſay) Thou canſt as well keep one hundred Children as one, (I know this is a Paradox,) But thou muſt know, thou canſt not keepe one (to ſpeake properly) no not thy ſelf, for thou and thine, yea, and all the Creatures in the world have their allowance from God, and are kept at his Table (as we may ſay) and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62199:31"/>
at his Charge; The Lord hath a great Family, but were it ten thouſand times bigger, he hath ſuch an inexhauſted ſtore-houſe of proviſion of all kinds, that not one of them could want; eaſe thy ſelfe then of thy cares (I meane di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting, and diſtruſtfull cares) and caſt them upon God, who careth for thee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>I am God al-ſufficient,</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) walke before me and be upright;</hi> Do thou but labour to walke before God and to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and then thou maieſt act faith on Gods Al-ſufficiency to do good to, and for thee and thine. Let me yet a little further argue with thee about this particular; Thou ſaieſt (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) thou art afraid that if thou ſhouldſt have many Children they would undo thee; How can this be? when the Lord affirmes Children to be a bleſſing; mind theſe two places, firſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.5. where the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of Children, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man who hath his quiver full of them;</hi> Secondly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that feareth the Lord, and walketh in his way;</hi> (But how is he bleſſed?) truly, this is one part of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, that his Wife ſhall be like a fruitfull Vine, and his Children like Olive branches round about his Table, <hi>Lothus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord,</hi> v. 3, 4. Children you ſee then are a bleſſing; Nay, many Children are a bleſſing; yea, they are as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeverall bleſſings. Now to apply this, what a prepoſterous thing is this for thee to ſay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children will undoe thee; Will bleſſings
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62199:32"/>
undoe any? It is very Incongruous to ſpeake or thinke ſo; it is impoſſible that bleſſings, as they are bleſſings, can hurt, much leſſe undoe any; I confeſſe the abuſe of bleſſings may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe thee, but this is <hi>per accidens,</hi> and ſprings from thy ſelfe; it is not the having many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that can undoe thee, but thy abuſe of ſo rich a bleſſing; there is no bleſſings in the world enjoy'd by any, but if they are unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied they will undoe thoſe that have the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; I have been the longer in this point, becauſe diſtruſt of the Lords providence in generall, (but more eſpecially) relating to meanes for maintenance of many Children is growne to be an Epidemicall diſeaſe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading the face of the Chriſtian World. Ah, truly let me ſay, that thou, whoſoever thou art, and my ſelfe too, ſhould not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to take ſhame for this exceeding vile ſin; Be then in the feare of God convinced, that the propagating of the Church in the procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children was an eſſentiall, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end why God did ordaine Marriage, and that which was the Lords end muſt be thy aime: and this ſhall ſuffice for this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond end of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>The ſecond end we are to aime at in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Marriage, is, the ſubduing our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and baſe luſts, eſpecially when we find them to be predominant; There is no man in this life but his Regeneration is only in part; (Sanctification here is at beſt but inchoate, in Heaven it ſhall be conſummated) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is obnoxious to temptations as in all kinds
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62199:32"/>
(having the ſeed of all ſins in him) ſo to the ſin of uncleanneſſe in particular; Yet it muſt be granted, that ſuch men as do enjoy this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance of Marriage are more free from the concupiſcence of the fleſh (eſpecially the violence of them) than they ordinarily are who enjoy not this bleſſed help. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth intimate as much, when he ſaith, <hi>To avoid fornication let every man have his own Wife, and every woman her own Husband,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. (which place to the like occaſion was mentioned before, though on another head) and in ver. 8, 9. he adds, <hi>if the unmarried cannot containe let them marry,</hi> and backs his exhortation with a reaſon <hi>(viz) it is better to marry than to burne;</hi> it is the duty of every one to labour to preſerve themſelves pure and chaſte Virgins unto Chriſt, which that perſon cannot do who hath an impure heart, though free from the acts of uncleanneſſe. <hi>He that looks on a woman to luſt after her hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Adultery in his heart,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. Chriſt alſo makes the heart the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeat and receptacle of Adultery and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <hi>Mat</hi> 15.19. Now for this heart-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement every ſoule hath cauſe, not only to be humbled, but alſo thankfully to make uſe of the remedy preſcribed of God againſt the ſame. When our Saviour reproves divorce betweene Man and Wife but in caſe of Fornication, and the ſin of thoſe that are juſtly divorced if they marry, the ſin alſo of thoſe who marry ſuch, his Diſciples ſay, if the caſe be ſo, it is not good
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62199:33"/>
to marry; Our Saviour Anſwers, <hi>All men cannot receive this ſaying ſave thoſe to whom it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Mat.</hi> 19.11. That is to ſay, all men cannot (nay, no man can) at pleaſure attaine this gift of Chaſtity (for it is the gift of God) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch to whom the Lord denies it ought to take the help of Marriage. But if the end of Mens Marrying be rather to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh than to ſubdue the ſame, they may juſtly feare themſelves as perſons never like to be gainers by ſuch conjunctions, but to have the fire of luſt ſo enkindled in their impure Natures, as that Chaſtity ſhall be made but combuſtible matter to be wholy conſumed thereby, and ſo made unſufferable loſers, which is a Judgement moſt dreadfull; let therefore the deſtruction and extirpation of impure-ſelfe be ſincerely thy aime, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in ſeeking the Marriage condition. We have done with this ſecond end of Marriage, and proceed to the laſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt end we are to aime at in deſiring Marriage, is, comfortable Society, to enjoy a ſolid, ſweet, and boſome Companion; in which Eſtate (for the moſt part) it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected man is a ſociable Creature, and therfore God would not have him live alone, but cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates him a meet helper, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18.

            <p>We are in the next place to come to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome things of the meanes we are to uſe to obtaine a meet helper.<note place="margin">The firſt meanes to obtaine a good wife.</note> The firſt meanes to drive on ſo pretious a deſigne by, as the gaining
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62199:35"/>
a meet helper, is prayer; The Lord takes it as his own prerogative in a ſpeciall manner to be the beſtower of good Wives. <hi>Houſe and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are the Inheritance of the Fathers, but a vertuous Wife is the gift of God, Pro.</hi> 19.14. Beloved in the Lord, there is no gift the Lord beſtoweth but is richly worth asking; and how can we aske but by Prayer? It is a mercy that God will let us know where a mercy is lodg'd: Now this mercy as well as others is lodg'd in Heaven, <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is from above, and commeth down from the Father of Lights, Jam.</hi> 1.17. Faithfull Prayer hath a long Arme, it can reach from Earth to Heaven; labour then to improve prayer aright for the obtaining this bleſſing, and waite upon God in the uſe of other meanes, and doubt not of good ſpeed; I am very confident, that theſe mercies are fulleſt of juyce that are given us from Heaven, as in anſwer to faithfull prayer; how full of ſplendor will thy Wife be in thy eye when thou look'ſt on her as given from Heaven? And by the way let me adde, that happy are thoſe Wives that are obtained by the faithfull prayers of their Husbands: For they ſhall be beſt beloved, and moſt prized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are received by their Husbands as a love-token ſent them from Heaven. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of <hi>Abraham</hi> was well acquainted with the meanes to gaine a good Wife for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Son; Aske ſome how they come by ſuch and ſuch a thing, and they will tell you they got it with a ſilver hooke, and ſuch a hooke
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62199:35"/>
they have that will bring them any thing in, (if you will beleeve them.) But this godly ſervant was furniſhed with ſilver and gold enough to make uſe of a hooke or hookes to have driven on his deſigne by, but he was better furniſhed than ſo, ſon he had the gracious hooke of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and with that he penetrates Heaven, and there lies he tugging till he had obtain'd the mercy of a good Wife, and meet helper for his young Maſter. The ſame courſe muſt thou take for to obtaine this mercy for thy ſelfe; and thou maieſt receive incouragement to walke firſt in this way of ſeeking God by prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other meanes be uſed, if thou wilt but take a ſurvey diligently of the bleſſed event the ſervant of <hi>Abraham</hi> had of his going to God for direction in this caſe: And ſo a bleſſing on his journey. As he that takes a wife without conſent of Parents can looke for no portion with her; ſo be ſure that he that takes a wife without the Lords conſent (as he doth in a ſenſe that begs her not of him by prayer, (can looke for no comfort, and comfort is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which God gives with his Daughters; nay, on the contrary, ſuch a man may expect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort inſtead of comfort, and a curſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a bleſſing. God knows how to meet with thee, and to cauſe all thy Gourds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to wither; make thy ſelf certaine of this, That is, if thou do neglect the performance of this duty of ſeeking God by prayer for a good Wife, that except thou be afterward deeply humbled for this ſin, the Marriage condition
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62199:36"/>
ſhall not be ſanctified to thee, and if not, thou wert better a thouſand times not live in that Eſtate of life; for thou canſt not expect ſo much as one Honey Month, (as we ſay) but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months and yeares of Gall and Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. We ſometimes adviſe our friends that they take heed they do not marry in haſt, leſt they repent at leiſure, Truly, they make too much haſte to marry that forget (much more ſlight) ſeeking God for direction, and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this way, therefore they ſhall have cauſe enough to repent; (but God grant they may repent aright, that the curſe may be turn'd into a bleſſing.) We have done with the firſt means we muſt uſe to obtaine a good Wife, that is, prayer.</p>
            <p>The ſecond meanes to obtaine this deſirable bleſſing, is, to looke at ſuch things in the choiſe of a Wife which makes her a good Wife, and a meet helper.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt ſay, what things are they? (or what particulars) that a man ought to look on in a woman as fitting her to be a good Wife, and meet helper?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, there may be ſome things inward, and ſome things outward making her ſuch, if ſhe enjoy them, or if not, the contrary.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded, what thoſe inward qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications be that make a woman a meet hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?<note place="margin">The firſt qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good wife.</note>
I anſwer, The firſt is Grace, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the true feare of God in the heart, by the fruits of holineſſe in the life; without this it is not poſſible that a woman can be a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62199:36"/>
meet helper; for if ſhe be unable (as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to contribute ſomething to make ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the neceſſities of the beſt part of a man, (that is, the ſoule;) How can ſhe be a meet helper? But a graceleſſe Wife is unable to contribute the leaſt mite this way, therefore ſhe can be no meet helper. <hi>Be not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>unequally yoaked with Infidels,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. which in the verſes following he labours to amplifie; There can be no ſpirituall ſociety between a gracious and ungracious ſpirit. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of Marrying in the Lord. The Wife is bound by the Law (ſaith the Apoſtle) as long as her Husband liveth: but if her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be dead ſhe is at liberty to marry whom ſhe will, only in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39. And to be joyn'd in holy wedlock to a gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is to marry in the Lord. The Apoſtle, in labouring to maintaine his own, and his fellow Apoſtles priviledges at large, particularizeth his, and their liberty to marry. <hi>Have we not power to lead about a Siſter, a Wife,</hi> &amp;c. power they had to marry, but his Wife muſt be a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. In the old world it was one of the principall ſins that did provoke God to drowne the Inhabitants thereof, that the Sons of God (and they were the godly men of that time) did marry with the Daughters of men, (that is, ungodly perſons,) <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. <hi>David</hi> tels us, that all his delight was in the Saints, even in thoſe that did excell in vertue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. It was the ſin of <hi>Solomon</hi> that he tooke Idolatrous Wives, which was the cauſe of ſad judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62199:37"/>
ſpirituall and temporall on him; his Wives drew away his heart from God to their falſe Gods, which was a ſpirituall judgement: And for his idolatrous Marriages, and his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry God divides his Kingdome, and leaves but a ſmall fag of it to him in his Sons daies, which was a temporall judgement, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. to the end of the 11. verſe. Nay, for his ſins (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ungodly Marriages was a ſpeciall one,) it hath been diſputable by many good Divines, whether he were ſaved or not? though the moſt Orthodoxe do conclude affirmatively; and they ground their Charity firſt upon that place, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.26. where he is ſaid to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his God (And <hi>whom God loveth, he loveth to the end, Joh.</hi> 13.1.) Their ſecond ground is, that he was a Penman of Scripture, and ſuch are call'd Holy men of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> from whence they conclude he could not periſh, for God will not damne holy ones. But we may ſafely conclude, that this ſin was very fearefull; <hi>Sampſon</hi> muſt have his <hi>Dalilah</hi> to dally with as a companion for his Bed, but it coſt him the loſſe of his eyes firſt, and then of his life and limbes, he had a bad and ſad portion with her. By the way, we may ſee they are much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that thinke it may be lawfull for a godly man to marry with a prophane Wife, even in hopes to be a means to convert her; I grant, that ſometimes it pleaſeth God to honour the believing Husband, or believing Wife to be an Inſtrument to convert the unbeliever: But for any to preſume of this at the time of woing,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62199:37"/>
or Wedding the Party oppoſite to the waies of God, is a groundleſſe preſumption; But were ſhe tractable to good Counſell, and a diligent frequenter of the meanes of Grace, there might be ſome footing for hope: But if not, feare having any ſociety with her, keep thy ſelfe at more than ſtaves length from her, for ſhe is more like to pervert thee than thou art like to convert her. <hi>Solomon,</hi> whom we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before,<note place="margin">1 King. 11.9.</note> was better fenced againſt the danger of ſuch temptations than thou art; for God had appeared unto him twice, which any good heart would have concluded, would ſo have conjoyned him to God, and to his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that he would never have made ſo much as a ſeeme-ſeparation from God; yet we ſee, that in the day of his temptation he fell back and ſtarted from God like a broken bow. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, let me then tell thee, that thou haſt no cauſe to preſume of doing ſuch a perſon good who is averſe from God, but of feare of thy own ſtedfaſtneſſe,<note place="margin">1 King. 21.25.</note> evill wives do many times make good men bad, but alwaies bad men worſe; a very Jade will draw more down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill than many good Horſes will be able to draw up againe: A carnall Wife will draw a man further from God, than many good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with all their Exhortations, reproofes, and good Counſels will be able to regaine back. Beloved, it is then but need for thee to make grace the object of thy love, that thou maieſt be guarded againſt thoſe dangers thou art other wiſe like to be environed with, even
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62199:38"/>
of being drawn from God, and the waies of his grace. Secondly, thou muſt make grace the Object of thy love in regard of the helps thou ſhalt find by a woman of a gracious ſpirit to further thee in thy holy profeſſion; She will be a meanes to rouſe thee up againſt ſecurity and worldly mindedneſſe; She will be a meanes of ſtrengthening thy weake faith, and to help thee againſt all diffidence and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.22, 23. She will be a meanes to ſtir thee up to love and good works; She will be a meanes to help thee in the growth of grace here, and ſo a meanes of thy happineſſe hereafter; (Here are more flowers to adde to thy begun-Noſegay in the laſt end of Marriage) bind them together and they will be very Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous to pleaſe thy ſenſes. Thirdly, thou haſt need to make grace the Object of thy love in chuſing a Wife, as thou deſireſt thy love ſhould hold out to the end; For if thou make Riches the Object of thy love, they may be loſt, they are ſubject to many caſualties. Riches have wings like an Eagle and may flye away, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. and when they are gone thy love will flye after. If thou make beauty the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thy love, that may vaniſh away, for favour is deceitfull, and beauty is vanity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.30. Beauty may be taken away by ſickneſſe, or by ſome accidentall blow in the face, by loſſe of an Eye, by a Canker in the Noſe, or ſome other meanes, and if once gone, love will go too. If thou make Perſon the Object of thy love, that may ſuffer much detriment,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62199:38"/>
crookedneſſe may grow in a body formerly ſtraight, ſuch a comely body may come to want a Leg or an Arme, which will be a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to it; Now Perſon being defective, love will be the ſame. If thou make hope of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Object of thy love, Thy wives great Kindred may faile of power to advance thee, nay of power to hold up themſelves; (we want not plentifull experience of this:) Or they may be prejudiced againſt thee and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate thy expectations, and make thee ſee too late that thou haſt but built Caſtles in the Aire to depend on them, ſo all hopes that way being loſt, thy love will be loſt too. Now when thy love hath fetcht its laſt gaſpe, it may be, happy were it for thee (in ſome ſenſe) if thou and thy love might be buried both in one grave, for after love is once departed, what will, or can thy life be but a condition of griefe and heart-ſorrow, and great diſcontentment, that thou ſhouldſt have a wife whom thou canſt take no pleaſure in, and wouldſt with all thy heart part with, and yet it may be thou ſhalt not part with her untill death cut thee off firſt. But if thou make Grace the Object of thy love, (and withall, art no whit miſtaken, but thou findeſt it to be in the heart of thy wife in deed, and in truth;) Then as grace doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo thy love will abound, but grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but encreaſe continually, therefore love will multiply in thy heart exceedingly. Now as thou deſireſt to be kept from Apoſtacy, or falling from God, and the waies of his grace:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62199:39"/>
And as thou deſireſt to be helped forward in all Chriſtian Counſels, and good waies: And as thou doſt deſire to keep life in thy love, and to encreaſe therein, to thy own comfort, and the comfort of thy wife, ſo let it be thy care, in the feare of God, to looke to thy own heart, that it deceive thee not, but that thou doſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make Grace the Object of thy love in the choice of thy wife; then thou maieſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly expect by the bleſſing of God much comfort in ſuch a Yoak-fellow in all thy wants of wealth, or health of ſoule or body, and mayeſt whileſt thou enjoyeſt her begin to write encomiums of her, and when ſhe is dead,<note place="margin">Gen 35.19, 20.</note> then with <hi>Jacob</hi> ſet up a pillar upon her Grave, and perhaps maieſt truly ſay, <hi>Many Daughters have done vertuouſly, but thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleſt them all; for favour is deceitfull, and beauty is vaine, but a woman that feareth the Lord, ſhe ſhall be praiſed: Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praiſe her in the Gates.</hi> Here we ſhall turne in and proceed no further in the amplification of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward qualification of a good wife.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good wife.</note> In the ſecond place, the chiefe qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good wife (next ſaving Grace) is ſweet diſpoſition of Nature, that ſhe be of a quiet and peaceable ſpirit; for it is much to be bewailed, that in divers men and women, that we doubt not in the leaſt meaſure but that they are very gracious, and deſire to prove their ſoules to God in all waies of holineſſe, yet are of bad Natures, and themſelves cannot but ſee it, and I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62199:39"/>
doubt not but they deſire to bewaile it before God in ſecret, and yet cannot attaine to have their Corruptions in this kind mortified in any comfortable way; yet it muſt be granted, that ſuch perſons are not (many times) comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſorts; And therefore thou that art to make choice of a wife haſt cauſe enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to avoid laying a Conjugall tye upon thy ſelfe, to live and dye with ſuch a woman, though otherwiſe one of good parts. If a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be of churliſh nature, &amp; of croſs diſpoſitons in the abſtract, ſhe will caſt ſuch a coole damp on her Husbands love, as may not only chill, but kill it; whereby (though ſhe may be a ſad ſufferer her ſelfe) ſhe will abundantly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice her Husband in his comforts, and may ſhorten his daies: For a man cannot live that cannot love; the love of any thing gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the mind to enjoy the ſame. A croſſe and tarte nature in a wife un-wifes her, (as I may ſay) for ſhe that is not a meet hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is either not a wife, or elſe a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one; for how can ſhe be ſaid to be a wife that is not a meet helper, who is unfit for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſociety? but ſuch a wife is as ſharp and bitter, touchy and tangue by nature, will not (ordinarily) be ſociable, loving, kind, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in her carriages and deportments to her Husband; and doth it not concerne thee to avoid her in thy choice of a wife, for ſuch a woman as we ſpeake of will not make a good Wife, nor good Mother, nor good Dame, or Miſtris, ſhe will not be good in any relation,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62199:40"/>
(I meane, in the latter part of this diſcourſe, where an untoward nature is predominant in a woman.) <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is is better to dwell in a corner of the houſe top, than with a brawling woman in a wide houſe, Prov.</hi> 21.9. He alſo ſaith, <hi>The contentions of a wife are a continuall drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Pro.</hi> 19.13. A continuall dropping will weare, waſt, and conſume ſtone, (as obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will prove). And truly, this dropping from a contentious wife will weare, waſte, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, not only all the comforts that her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band otherwiſe might have in her, but his skin, fleſh, bone, marrow, and vitall ſpirits, and all in time. The Apoſtle tels us, that <hi>a meeke and quiet ſpirit in a woman is of great price with God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. And ſo it is doubtleſſe with every rationall man; therefore as thou wouldſt avoid many inconveniences in the Marriage Eſtate, and wear the comforts of it as a Crown of all temporall felicity: So labour to gaine a woman of ſweet naturall diſpoſitions, of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Amiable and Affable carriage, of a meeke and quiet ſpirit, the happineſſe whereof will be permanent.</p>

carefull in thy Choice to ſatisfie thine Eye, both in the Perſon and Favour of ſuch a One as thou wouldſt enjoy for thy Conſort, both in Bed, and at Board, (as we ſay) And in this thou muſt be ſomewhat curious.

Secondly, there is a Prudentiall Curioſity, and that is, when a man laies a ground-worke of Contentation before-hand (yet therein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a Mediocrity too) for the future. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is a conſcientious Curioſity; and that is when a Chriſtian labours to prevent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo to circumvent his ſpirituall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Now the firſt, that is, Unneceſſary Curioſity is to be condemned, but the other two to be commended, for they provide for purity of heart and life, as alſo for perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting love and ſweet ſociety. Firſt, it provides for purity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and prevents the contrary; for by undeniable conſequence it will follow, That he who doth not rejoice in the Wife of his Youth; and he whoſe Wife is not to him as a loving Hind and pleaſant Roe, will be raviſht with a ſtrange woman, and embrace the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of a ſtranger, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>Rebecca</hi> was beautifull and faire, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.7.

acquaint thee, that I knew a Gentleman who was very godly, that being to looke out for a Wife (which was indeed to be a ſecond wife,) he tooke ſpeciall care to meet with one truly gracious, and of a ſweet, loving, and meek na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (and I am able with much confidence to averre he was not fruſtrate therein;) But in the meane time did deny himſelfe about her perſon, for he was ſo taken with the other two, that he accepted of a perſon crooked, and of hard favour; but within ſhort time (ſad is it to tell) he takes her defects into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by degrees fals to ſlight his wife, and then to hate her, and take no delight in ſociety with her, who being once (in ſpeciall) in a great paſſion and rage againſt her in the time of Family Prayer, did in her own hearing, and in the preſence of divers of his Children, (growne up to ſome diſcretion) and alſo in the hearing of his Servants, earneſtly beg of God to diſcover unto him that great ſin of his that did provoke him to give him a crooked wife. Truly, it was a crooked prayer, and did migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily diſturbe (and not without cauſe) this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wife. It is true, that favour is deceitfull, and beauty is vanity, as hath been conſidered already: But that hath been only in relation to the making it the Object of thy love, for ſo it is vaine and ſinfull; yet it hath its uſe, and ſome eyes muſt have many graines of it too to make a well accompliſhed wife for them. Here by the way, how much then are thoſe Parents to blame, that ſtraine their power
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62199:42"/>
over their Children beyond due limits, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engagements and commands on them to like of ſuch perſons for Husbands, and Wives, for them, as they ſhall thinke moſt meet, which if they will not (becauſe many times they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, by reaſon they are not able to cloſe in their hearts and affections with their perſons and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;) then they muſt be frown'd upon, call'd diſobedient Children, and diſinherited, caſt off as if they were but a baſtard Generation: But if this (in a ſpeciall manner) be not a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Children to wrath, and a diſcouraging of them, I know not what is; which ſin of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents the Apoſtle forbids, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.21. Now in the feare of God let Parents be admoniſhed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this ſin, of enforcing their Children to accept of ſuch Husbands, and Wives, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only choſe without, nay, againſt the free conſent of their Children. But if Parents will not be exhorted to the contrary, let them know, that they are in a high degree acceſſary to all the brawlings and contentions that fall out after ſuch Marriages betweene their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they muſt anſwer before the Bar of Gods Tribunall for all breach of Covenant, all Marriage-bed defilement, for all poyſonings, or other bloudy plots to take away the naturall lives of either perſon; and they are guilty of all diſorders, of all non-performance of Family duties, of all diſhonour brought to God by their Children in the Marriage eſtate, and (ſo by undeniable conſequence) of their Childrens Damnation for ſuch ſins, though the Children
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62199:43"/>
are accomptable before God for their owne ſins too. Thou that art a Father, or Mother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſaying, <hi>Call the Maid and aske at her mouth, Gen.</hi> 24.57.

               </note>In the fourth place, if thou wouldſt have a meet helper thou muſt looke at fitneſſe of Age in that woman whom thou deſireſt to be thy Wife; Or elſe how canſt thou expect meet helpe from her in all conditions; If a man of fit age for Marriage chuſe a girle for his Wife, or if a Young Man Marry with an old woman, and expect furtherance from ſuch in that eſtate of life, they befoole themſelves; for the Girle ſtands in need of a Dame to inſtruct her in all points of womanhood to fit her for to be a good wife, and the old woman ſtands in need of a Nurſe to waite on her in her decrepid Age. Now in this particular we ſhall uſe the more conciſeneſſe, becauſe we have ſpent ſome time this way before, yet we muſt confeſſe, thoſe lines did chiefly relate to cautionate the Man not to mind Marriage before ripe in Age for that ſtate of life; But as a man muſt not marry till of fit Age, ſo neither muſt he chuſe a wife therein unfit; yet both Divinity and Philoſophy will juſtifie that man that doth match himſelfe to a Girle, rather than he who doth marry an old woman; for a Girle may in time become a woman fit to beare Children, and guide the houſe, as the Apoſtle requires,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62199:43"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.14. which are ſpirituall ends of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: But the old woman will be more and more unfit; Now though it be not convenient that a woman of eight or ten yeares older than the man ſhould be joyn'd in Marriage with him, yet no man of underſtanding dare deny, but that it may be lawfull, provided that the woman be not paſt Child-bearing, and withall, be of an able and healthfull conſtitution: But if otherwiſe, two ſpeciall ends of Marriage are fruſtrate, and then it is a ſin againſt God, and Nature too, to be ſo joyned in Marriage: But when a man about twenty ſixe yeares old ſhall be married to a Maid of about twenty, or a Man about thirty yeares old ſhall marry with a maid about twenty foure, ſuch Conjunctions are of good report; and ſuch perſons, as they are Youthfull together, ſo they grow aged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and are never eſtranged in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions one towards another, if other qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo correſpond. And beſides, the fruit of ſuch Marriages ordinarily (by the bleſſing of God) is to have Children betimes in youthfull daies, when their Parents can beſt care for them, and take paines with them, which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if the Lord give them grace, prove as a ſtaffe or ſupport to their Parents, (under God) in their old Age, which is a bleſſing abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirable. But all men both Religious and Morall do condemn ſuch men as in their youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full daies will (for any ſiniſter end in the world) joyne themſelves in Marriage with women of above fifty (nay,<note place="margin">Gen 18.23.</note> ſometimes above ſixty) yeares
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62199:44"/>
Old. There can be no Iſſue from ſuch Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, unleſſe God worke a miracle, which who can expect without great preſumption. And beſides, this diſagreement in yeares breeds a diſagreement in life; for a young man cannot entirely love a woman ſo much older than himſelfe, that when he is in the prime of his yeares and ſtrength, that then his wife ſhould be crazie, unhealthfull, unhandſome (for him to have neere ſociety with,) and of a withered body, whereby he is Obnoxious to an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of temptations of all kinds, from his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies (even) to uncleanneſſe, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled paſſions, to Company-keeping, and ſo to the neglect of the duties of his Calling, and of his Family, and ſo to laviſh expence, to the undoing of him and his; thus I leave to thy ſelfe to judge, whether a fit Age be a good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in a woman to make her a meet hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to thee in the Marriage eſtate or no.</p>

I would have every man in a due place, and with ſome moderation of his exorbitant affections, not only look after, but labour for, a convenient portion with his wife in Marriage, and that as he deſires her to be a meet helper. And firſt, becauſe the things of this life are the good Creatures of God: they are bleſſings, nay, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſings, when ſanctified to us, &amp; of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall uſe to us whileſt we are in this our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to carry us through the world without diſtractions and worldly encumbrances, that we may with the more enlargedneſſe of heart walke with our God in a holy Converſation and that with cheerefulneſſe: Only, we had need take great heed <hi>we truſt not in uncertaine Riches, but in the living God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 17. and that <hi>if Riches encreaſe we ſet not our hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, Pſal.</hi> 62.10.

Againe in the ſecond place, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a man to mind a portion with his Wife, becauſe it is the duty of Parents to lay up por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for, &amp; to give portions to their Children, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. The Apoſtle laies it down poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that <hi>it is the duty of Parents to lay up for their Children:</hi> though he apply the ſame in a ſpirituall ſenſe. <hi>Job</hi> gave his Daughters Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance among their Brethren, <hi>Job</hi> 42.15. <hi>Elkanab</hi> gives unto his Sons and Daughters Portions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.4.

In the third and laſt place, a man may looke at portion with a wife, becauſe he cannot live at ſo low a rate when he is married as he could when he was a ſingle man, and his wife doth encreaſe (or help to encreaſe) this his Charge, therefore there is all the reaſon in the world ſhe ſhould bring ſome additionall maintenance; <hi>For Money anſwereth all things,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 10.19.

nor Angell can deny, for Children are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Lord, and the fruit of the wombe is his reward, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127 31. It was the Lord that opened <hi>Leahs</hi> wombe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.31. And it was the Lord that did with-hold from <hi>Rachel</hi> the fruit of her wombe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.2.) yet in ſome ſenſe Parents may be ſaid to have bought their Children, for their Mothers buy them deare, they conceive them, beare them, and bring them into the world with great pain and griefe, ſometimes Children coſt their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their lives in Child-birth, or Child-bed; <hi>Benjamin</hi> coſt his precious Mother her life at ſuch a time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.17.18. The Tree doth ſometimes wither and dye that the fruit may live: And when Children are borne they coſt both Fathers and Mothers much paine, coſt, griefe, and feare in bringing them up. They have much trouble and watchings early and late about them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides, what heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paines doth Parents take to leave ſome maintenance for their Children? Children then you ſee coſt their Parents deare. There is no man can ſay that he hath ſo good an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in any thing he doth enjoy as Parents have in their Children, they are bone of their bone, and fleſh of their fleſh. Now then from this Intereſt Parents have in their Children, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares evidently, we may conclude thus much, That it is an offence and a ſin of an high nature for Children to beſtow themſelves in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age without, much more if againſt, the free conſent of their Parents; Firſt, humbly ſought
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62199:49"/>
and obtained; Secondly, Great is the power which the Lord of all Creatures in Heaven and in Earth hath Inveſted (I ſay) Parents with over the bodies of their Children; (for we muſt know, that God is the Father of ſpirits in a more peculiar manner, and hath them wholly and ſolely at his own command,) and that in relation to the beſtowing them in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Parents have power to beſtow their Daughters in Marriage, and to take wives for their Sons, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.3. which I gather from that place by the rule of contraries, but the Text is moſt properly an Inhibition of corrupt Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; but more full to this purpoſe is that place in <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.6. Where the Lord ſpeakes thus, <hi>Take ye Wives and beget Sons and Daughters. And take you Wives for your Sons, and give your Daughters to Husbands;</hi> Which makes this point cleare. That the Lord (I once more ſay) doth Inveſt Parents with a full power over their Children in relation to Marriage; (yet miſtake me not, I dare not thinke, much leſſe ſay, that Parents have a power to force their Children againſt their own wils to marry or be married as they pleaſe; I only intend, that though Children muſt have their own free conſents to marry with ſuch or ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that yet they may not, nor lawfully can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without the conſent of their Parents;) So that from this power God hath given Parents over their Children, we do againe averre the truth of the former Concluſion, that is, That it is an Offence and ſin of an high nature for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62199:50"/>
Children to beſtow themſelves in marriage without (much more if againſt) the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their Parents. But to lay this ſin yet cloſer to the hearts of curſed and rebellious Children, let them know, and know it aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is as cleare a truth as is involved in Gods Booke (with reverence be it expreſt) that for them to beſtow themſelves in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age thus without (much more, I ſay, againſt) the conſent of their Parents, is a Capitall breach of the fifth, ſeventh, and eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Decalogue; Firſt, they tranſgreſſe againſt the fifth Commandement, for therein God commands them <hi>to honour their Father and Mother;</hi> And by this their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing themſelves in Marriage againſt their conſents they caſt the greateſt diſhonour upon them that can be thought, for by this act of theirs they ſeeme to diſpute (nay, they do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute) their Parents Intereſt over them: nay, further, the validity of the free Donation of <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelfe, who hath, as you have heard, given Children to be under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, even in this particular to which we ſpeake; and theſe Miſcreants, theſe Rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hels, ſay with thoſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let us breake their bonds aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> Secondly, theſe undutifull Children do violate the ſeventh Commandement, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> Now this is a moſt undeniable truth, that thoſe who preſume to ſtep into the Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in a way point blanke to that which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62199:50"/>
God hath ordained, never lawfully enter into ſuch a condition; but ſuch as having Parents living do Marry againſt their conſent, do ſtep into that condition, point blanke to that way which God hath ordained: Therefore ſuch as ſo marry never lawfully enter into that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if two be not lawfully Married, they be not man and wife, then what they are you may eaſily determine: You may ſay they are a couple of uncleane perſons, or a Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a Whore, and ſo they will be till they labour to be humbled for their uncleane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for their diſobedience againſt God and their Parents, and have gained God and their Parents to be reconciled to them, and till then I once more ſay, they live in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all breach of the ſeventh Commandement. Laſtly, They tranſgreſs againſt the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, for therein God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale;</hi> Now ſuch as marry againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Parents are the greateſt thieves in the world. You may remember that I told you that Children are dearer to their Parents than all that beſides they enjoy, and that they have bought them very deare: Now if thieves breake the eighth Commandement, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe that thus marry againſt their Parents conſent, being thieves, do breake that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. How fearefull then is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſuch perſons as they? The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he which keeps the whole Law and failes but in one point is guilty of all, Jam.</hi> 2.10. How much more guilty muſt ſuch be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62199:51"/>
who faile in three points, as thoſe hot-ſpurs do who make more haſte than good ſpeed? <hi>Sampſon</hi> had better learned, and did better practice, He tels his Father and Mother that he had ſeen a woman in <hi>Timnah</hi> that pleaſed him well, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.2. then in ver. 3. he pleads for their conſent; Now untill he had gotten the conſent of his Parents he would not marry, then in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. his Father and Mother went down with him to <hi>Timnah</hi> to his Marriage; Mind well the carriage of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant, which was made uſe of before on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.33. and ſo forward. Therefore when thou doſt deſire to marry, and haſt ſpied out a perſon whom thou canſt love, then firſt acquaint thy own Parents with it, ſeek their counſell and conſent, which when thou haſt obtained, breake the matter to the Maids friends, but ſtep not one foot further till Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are ſatisfied on both ſides, and then do as God and friends ſhall direct. I ſhall wade no further in this third meanes, but come to the laſt.</p>
            <p>Yet, before we proceed thereto, here fals in a caſe of Conſcience, ariſing from the laſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, namely, whether a man may under no conſideration beſtow himſelfe in Marriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conſent of parents? This is neceſſary to be ſpoken to in this place for ſome poor ſoul may object, and ſay,</p>
            <p>I apprehend in my ſelfe a cleare Call to change my ſingle condition, and to enjoy the Marriage eſtate, for I find my ſelfe in ſome
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62199:51"/>
poore meaſure fit for it; God having graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly beſtowed on me thoſe gifts before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in ſome degrees; and this I am ſure of, I am unfit for the ſingle life, having not the gift of Chaſtity, but upon all occaſions burn with fleſhly concupiſcence, to Gods diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to the waſting of all my ſpirituall comforts. I have uſed thoſe meanes you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obtaine a good wife, and by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious providence I have found out a maid largely qualified to make a good wife; and now the obſtacle is, my Parents like it not that I ſhould enjoy her as my wife, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hath too much of the feare of God in her, as they think, and not outward portion ſo much as they would have me enjoy with a wife; and truly, I have long waited for their conſents, and uſed the beſt meanes I can to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſame, but do even deſpaire of ever gaining of it; now Sir, I beſeech you, give me a word or two of counſell and direction what I ſhall do in this caſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Deare heart, I condole thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cannot but ſympathize with thee; I ſee thou art in a conflicting eſtate with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, with thy corruptions, and with thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and degenerate Parents; yet there is ſome Balme in <hi>Gilead</hi> for thee, only firſt take by the way a word or two of adviſe; It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares thou art qualified for, and call'd to the Marriage eſtate, and haſt a fit opportunity to change thy life, only the obſtruction ſticks here, thy Parents will not conſent, and that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62199:52"/>
upon the grounds thou haſt ſpoken of; Then (I ſay) in the feare of the Lord ſet apart a day, two, or three, to ſeeke God by Faſting, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Prayer, there bewaile thy own ſins in generall, that they may have had an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the hearts of thy Parents to bind them up and harden them againſt thee; But if thou doſt know any particular ſin that thou haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated, and that God may maintaine a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie againſt thee for it this way, be ſure Anatomize that before the Lord (on that day of thy humiliation) rip it up, let all the curſed lineaments of it appeare, labour to affect thy Heart with the conſideration of all the ſad cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and aggravations of the ſame, and rent the Caule of thy heart before the Lord by unfeigned humiliation, and implore his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for pardon and reconciliation. Then in a ſecond place ſeek to God to humble thee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for thy Parents ſin. Thirdly, ſeek God to humble thy Parents for their Iniquities, and to pardon their ſin. Laſtly, ſeek God to be gracious to thee in wheeling their hearts toward thee. Now when thou haſt this done, and yet haſt not prevailed, beg the prayers of ſuch as have an intereſt in God, both for thy ſelfe, and for thy Parents; which done, if no cloud yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare for thy comfort ſo big as a mans hand, then deſire ſome godly Miniſters, and other worthy Chriſtians to grapple with thy Parents by perſwaſive Arguments tending to the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their frozen hearts, and for the turning them toward thee. Now if none of theſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62199:52"/>
meanes can prevaile, then wait a convenient time, expecting ſome comfort for thee; but if none come, and that thy neceſſities remaine ſtill for the enjoyment of the Marriage eſtate,<note place="margin">Acts 5.29.</note>
then know thou art bound to obey God rather than man: God commands thee to marry, though thy Parents forbid thee. In ſuch a caſe, I am confident, that thou ſhalt not ſin by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying againſt the unreaſonable deſires of thy Parents; Mind that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord, for that is right.</hi> Parents muſt not be obeyed but in the Lord. God is the Father of ſoules and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, now the ſpirit is the better part of a man, we muſt obey our ſpirituall Father rather than our Earthly. When the Apoſtle had ſpoke of ſubjection to our Earthly Fathers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. he adds, <hi>Shall we not much rather be in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Father of ſpirits, and live.</hi> To draw to a concluſion, Obey thy heavenly Fathers call in this particular, and with all humility and thankfulneſſe enter into the Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; yet one thing let me add, thou muſt labour to carry thy ſelfe with much care in the humble obſervance of thy Parents in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, and to counſell thy wife to do the ſame, and then thou knowſt not but that the Lord may give thee in their hearts, to thine, and thy Yoak-fellowes great comfort even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Marriage. But to ſhut up all, let not any thing here diſcuſt be underſtood as to weaken the power of Parents over their Children, in relation to their Marriage, for that power is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62199:53"/>
of God, and it is inviolable, but in this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar condition, which bleſſed be the Lord doth not often fall out, though too often.</p>

               <note place="margin">The fourth meanes to obtaine a good wife.</note>In the fourth and laſt place, If thou doſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have a good Wife, and a meet helper: Then thou muſt be very carefull to ſeek by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meanes and (by no other) to obtaine the love of the woman whom thou doſt affect with Conjugall love, and whom thou doſt deſire may be thy yoak fellow to live and dye with. Now for thy orderly and Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with her, I ſhall endeavour very brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give thee a few directions. When thou ſhalt come firſt to ſpeech with her (thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt gained the conſent of Parents on both ſides,) then let her underſtand with as much brevity as thou canſt (in regard of her baſhfulneſſe and modeſty) the truth of thy love and hearty affection to her; deſiring her to take it into her conſideration, and to conſult with God, and her Parents about it; and then to do as God ſhall perſwade her heart, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents adviſe her. Thou maieſt alſo then (or at the next meeting) declare unto her the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of thy Nature, alſo what Eſtate thou haſt to live on, and what Calling thou art of, (if ſhe be a ſtranger thereto:) But be ſure thou tell her the truth, and nothing but the truth, dealing faithfully with her in theſe, and in whatſoever elſe is neceſſary for her to know: After which give her a ſeaſonable time to conſider of all. Now when thou haſt thus done let thy affections ſleep, (but thy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62199:53"/>
judgement be kept waking.) leave all to God, commit this thy way to him, truſt alſo in the Lord, and if it be for his glory and thy good he will bring it to paſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. In the meane time ſit down quietly, and reſt patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not diſtracting thy ſelfe for the event of any thing. Now if after all this thou receive an Anſwer to this effect, That ſhe can love thy Perſon, like thy Nature, accept of thy Eſtate, and approve of thy Calling, and that ſhe is very well content to live and dye with thee: Then in the Name and feare of God thou maieſt proceed to a Contraction, and in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time to conſummate the Marriage, and thou maieſt expect (through the bleſſing of God a great deale of Comfort, and be ſure to find it when thy proceedings have been ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. But ſuppoſe that when ſhe returnes an Anſwer to thee, that it be an anſwer of repulſe, That ſhe cannot love thee, nor approve of any thing (in relation to thee) ſo well as to beſtow her ſelfe on thee, and doth entreat thee to be well ſatisfied, and to take it for an Anſwer, I ſay, ſuppoſe it to be thus: Then thou muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſearch into thy heart and life to find out the cauſe of it; for God hath ſome hand in it to humble thee for ſome ſin; happily thou haſt hid ſome curſed thing in thy heart, as <hi>Achan</hi> did the wedge of gold and Babyloniſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Earth in the middeſt of his Tent, for which ſin of his all Iſrael were beaten back by the Citizens of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I deſire to adde one thing yet further, (and that by way of Advice,) Be very circumſpect that before Marriage thou be not prodigall in thy engagements, be ſure thou promiſe her no more Maintenance than thou art well aſſured thy meanes will make good, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it is more ſafe and creditable for thee rather to promiſe nothing to her that way, (but yet to do what with reaſon may be fitting.) One thing more, and no more of this, Conceale not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand any deficiency in Nature that may diſable thee to performe any Conjugall duties whatſoever.

The greateſt part of a womans outward comfort in Marriage ſtands in the entire love and hearty Affections of her Husband toward her, and if ſhe miſſe of this from her Husband, ſhe may feare his falling ſhort in all the reſt, for the love of a Husband to his Wife is as the foundation ſtone of all his other duties; it is as the chiefe wheele in the Clock which gives a dexterous motion to all the other wheeles; thy cordiall love to thy Wife will ſweeten her condition in this life in her worſt outward croſſes, in want of health, wealth, the ſociety of good Neighbours, pleaſures, and what not; nay, let her life be

Now the Husband muſt labour to edifie and build up his Wife, and to further her in the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe by his performance of theſe particular duties, <hi>(viz.)</hi> By Dehortations, Exhortations, Reprehenſions, (and as occaſion is) by labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give her Conſolations: So alſo by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her, and with her; by reading the Word of God to her, and by holy Conference as frequently as may be: For by praying for her he may find the Lord graciouſly intreated to confer and beſtow Grace into her heart, and to give her a daily encreaſe thereof. Secondly, By praying with her he may be a meanes to put life and quickning into her ſpirit in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thirdly, By reading the Word of God to her he may inſtruct her. Fourthly, By uſing holy Conference with her he may ſtir up in her ardent deſires, and Heavenly Affections in minding things of a more ſublime Nature than any thing in this tranſitory life: And if ſhe be ignorant of the waies of God, and the duties ſhe doth owe unto God and man, it muſt be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62199:57"/>
the care of her Husband to informe her, to teach and inſtruct her in thoſe things: But if ſhe know them, then he muſt labour to rub them afreſh upon her Memory, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> did on them to whom he wrote, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. that ſhe may ſet her ſelfe the more ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the practice of them. Beloved, a man is no way able to ſhew his love more unto his Wife than by labouring that ſhe may be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly happy as well as himſelfe: And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that woman who doth enjoy ſuch a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as is very tender of her ſoules health; and who doth labour to further her in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of all her duties in her generall and particular Calling, even in doing the Will of God, and inſuffering his pleaſure. We might have been larger in this particular, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhould, but that in the next head we ſhall have occaſion to mention ſome of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned directions againe, as very proper to the next duty of the Husband to the Wife, and ſo deſiſt here.</p>

               <note place="margin">The fourth duty of the Husband to his Wife.</note> In the fourth place, the duty of the Husband to the Wife, is, to labour to reclaime her from any ſin, and ſinfull courſe ſhe doth live in; for ſin is of a deceitfull nature, and will deceive the ſoules of the choiceſt Chriſtians in the world if not rooted out betimes before the heart be hardened therein: And therefore the Holy Ghoſt bids us exhort one another to day to prevent the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. Therefore if a man ſee his wife nouriſh any ſin in her heart or life, he had need to beſtir himſelfe to make

But if it be demanded what be the meanes the Husband muſt uſe to reclaime his Wife from any ſin? I anſwer,—Firſt, Earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Supplication to God in her behalfe this way. When the Church had gone aſtray from God, and had run themſelves into many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſeekes unto God in their behalfe, thus, <hi>Turne thou unto us O Lord, and we ſhall be turned, renew our daies as of old, Lam.</hi> 5.21.<note place="margin">Gen. 25.21.</note> As God heard <hi>Iſaac</hi> praying for his Wife for a fruitfull wombe, that ſhe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and beare; ſo how knoweſt thou but that thou maieſt by Prayer prevaile with God in thy Wives behalfe, that ſhe may conceive the ſeed of ſaving Grace in her heart, and bring forth the fruit of it in her life, even the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that ſin or ſins that are moſt predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in her? and with much comfort maieſt thou expect ſuch a bleſſing on thy Prayers if they be fervent, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16. God hath the hearts of all men and women in his hands, and can turne them at his own pleaſure; he can make a proud heart humble, a hard heart ſoft, an Earthly heart Heavenly, a crooked heart ſtraight; he can help the perverſeneſſe of the Will, and the diſorder of the Affections; God hath a Plaiſter for every ſore, and a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for every diſeaſe; God can help the

Now theſe infirmities which a Husband out of duty to his wife muſt beare with muſt not be publike, nor giving ſcandall and offence to others; Nay, whatever they are he muſt take a fit opportunity to give her a

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſeventh duty of the Husband to his Wife.</note>The ſeventh duty the Husband doth owe unto his Wife, is, due maintenance in all things, both inward and outward, for her comfortable bodily ſubſiſtance here, both in life, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, for ſupportation of health whileſt it is enjoyed, and for reſtoration of it when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed. And this to be performed with as much deareneſſe of affections, and tenderneſſe of heart as to himſelfe; which duty the Apoſtle clearely requires husbands to performe to their wives, <hi>Eph</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies, be that loveth his wife loveth himſelfe, for no man ever yet hated his own fleſh: but cheriſheth, and nouriſheth it, even as Chriſt doth his Church.</hi> Now we know all men will nouriſh their own bodies with ſuch meat, and drink, and Phyſick, with ſuch Preſervatives, and Reſtoratives of health as is neceſſary. And they will cheriſh their own body with ſuch Apparell as may not only keep them warme in their bodies, but be ſome delight unto their minds. The ſame for kind, and meaſure, for quality and quantity they muſt allow unto their wives, (if it be of neceſſity or neceſſary for them, which I dare preſume it is almoſt alwaies.) Yet this muſt be granted, that a man muſt not maintaine himſelfe in any

thing, either for food or rayment, above his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or unbecoming his place and Calling: Neither muſt he allow it his wife; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe no diſcreet wife will deſire the ſame. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved you have heard at large that it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Husband to his Wife to tender the good of her ſoule, and can any man think that the good of her body is to be neglected? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it were abſurd for any to conceit any ſuch thing. God would not have the mouth of the Oxe to be muzled when he treadeth out the Corne,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.4.</note> and will he have the mouth of her muzled that doth draw with thee in the ſame yoke? Surely no, The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>he is worſe than an Infidell that doth not provide for his own Family,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. Now if the whole Family muſt be provided for, as none dare deny, then much more ſhe who in thy abſence is the head of the Family, and in thy own preſence thy right-hand Mate. VVhat encouragement can thy wife have to ſeek thy good when thou ſhalt in whole, or in part neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect hers. Beſides, when thou ſhalt (eſpecially with cheerefulneſſe) allow thy wife all due and neceſſary maintenance for her comfort and encouragement in this life, if ſhe have any ingenuity of nature in her ſhe will ſoone give the fruit of the ſame into thy boſome by a more vigorous and dexterous putting forth her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt abilities to ſerve, help, and comfort thee in all thy various conditions; but it herein thou who art her Husband art niggardly, penurious, and baſe hearted and handed towards thy

wife, thou maieſt perhaps (though it be her ſin) have ſuch poore returnes, that thou ſhalt not crack of thy gaines and incombs; But be thou perſwaded that maintenance is the wives due, and be thou carefull to diſcharge that debt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The eighth duty of the Husband to his Wife.</note>The eighth duty which the Husband doth owe unto his wife, is, to labour to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (under God) to protect her from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, wrongs, inſolencies, and contumelious abuſes, that any of the Sons or Daughters of <hi>Belial</hi> ſhall put upon her, to the utmoſt of his power. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. the Apoſtle tels us that <hi>the Husband is the head of his wife, even as Chriſt is the head of his Church;</hi> and he is the Saviour of his body: where take notice, that firſt this duty of a Husbands protecting his wife is implyed. Secondly, a preſident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to incite us to the performance of it. Firſt, this duty is implyed, the husband is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated to be the head of his wife: Now the head doth labour to fore-ſee, firſt, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the body is in. Secondly, to contrive means to prevent it. And thirdly, to project and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſome meanes afterward for the removing of the evill if it fall. And thus muſt a Husband labour to do in relation to his wife; He muſt labour to fore-ſee what wrongs may fall upon his wife before-hand, leſt they come una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares. Secondly, he muſt wiſely prevent them if he can, which if he cannot, then in the third place he muſt labour to remove them, and ſo to eaſe his wife from the burthen of them.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62199:65"/>
Secondly, here is a preſident propounded to incite the Husband to labour to protect his wife, and that from the example of Chriſt himſelfe, Chriſt is the Saviour of his body (the Church) which is his ſpouſe: ſo muſt the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band labour to defend and protect his wife, his ſpouſe, his body; yet further are we to labour this to do even from the practice of very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. The wife of <hi>Potiphar</hi> tels a ſeeming faire tale (but it was a moſt Diabolicall lye) to her husband, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had done her wrong, and had mockt her, which complaint of hers was believed by her husband. Now though <hi>Joſeph</hi> was choicely beloved of his Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet now his wrath is kindled againſt him, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> muſt to priſon for the pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.17, 19, 20. <hi>Heſter</hi> had put up a complaint to <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> her husband, (and a juſt complaint too,) That ſhe and her people were ſold to be deſtroyed, to be ſlaine, and to periſh. The King her husband demands who he was? and where he was that durſt preſume in his heart to do this? <hi>Heſter</hi> returns anſwer, that the Adverſary that had done this was that wicked <hi>Haman;</hi> upon which the Kings wrath was ſo enkindled againſt him, (though he were his chiefe favourite,) that he could not be pacified untill ſuch time as <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6, 10.</p>
            <p>In the ninth place it is the duty of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to his wife, in a prudentiall way,<note place="margin">The ninth duty of the Husband to his Wife.</note> with all ſweetneſſe and love, to labour to prevent her from an idle and unprofitable expence of time.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62199:66"/>
A husband in the generall ſhould labour to make his wife a compleat Chriſtian. Now he or ſhe that are not fit for Chriſtian ſociety are no compleat Chriſtians: But the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from every brother that did walke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. Now if you would know what that ſin was which is call'd a diſorderly walking, if you pleaſe to confer with the 10. and 11. verſes, you will find it was the ſin of not working, the ſin of Idleneſſe. Now in this point I would not be miſtaken, I would have none conceive that I ſhould thinke that it were fit for a husband to be a Task-maſter to his wife, to ſet her a ſtint of worke, and to exact it of her, (which was the ſin of the cruell <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> againſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (who were Gods own people,) <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8.) But if it be demanded, what imployment is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the wife to look after? I anſwer, with the mother of <hi>Solomon</hi> (in the firſt place,) <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.27. ſhe muſt look well to the waies of her Houſhould, Secondly, I anſwer with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.14. ſhe muſt guide the houſe; it is an excellent and well beſeeming carriage in a wife to look out ſharpe (as we may ſay,) to prevent ſervants Idleneſſe, and waſtefulneſs, for there was never worſe ſervants in an Age than now; they muſt have great wages, but do little worke for it; they will not gather up the broken fragments that nothing be loſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.12.

And as it is an excellent and well-beſeeming carriage in a wife thus to overſee the waies of her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo it is a very choice peece of ſervice in her in the acceptation of her husband. Againe, in anſwer to the former demand, (that is,) What is the proper imployment of a wife to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? In the third place, it is not out of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Calling to ſpend ſeaſonable time in inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſociety with her husband to quicken and enlive the affections of each other, one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But for that ſin of a womans in miſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her time in an idle and letty way, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (as beforeſaid) ſhould take care to prevent; for idleneſſe is (as we ſay) the mother of all miſchiefe; And I well like that ſpeech of a grave Divine, that is, That the Divill hath a Commiſſion to take up all idle perſons, and to imploy them in his ſervice. This ſhall ſuffice for this ninth duty of the husband to his wife, and ſo we proceed to the tenth and laſt duty that the husband doth owe as beforeſaid.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place it is the duty of the husband to the wife,<note place="margin">The tenth duty of the Husband to his VVife.</note> to take care ſo to mannage his eſtate whileſt opportunity ſerves, that he may be able to leave ſome competent eſtate for her

to maintaine her when God ſhall take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death, (if God thinke fit ſhe ſhall be the ſurviver.) we have already taken notice, that Parents muſt lay up for their Children, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. But a mans wife ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of him much dearer than chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that becauſe they are one fleſh, which Parents and Children are not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man ought in his will to have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his wife than to his children, except firſt the children be Infants, or every way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helpfull to themſelves; and that their mother be youthfull and of an able body, and in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to look out in a probable way to have a competent maintenance; and alſo in a ſecond place, except the mother be of a very harſh and bitter ſpirit to her Children, and ſo like to be as a ſtep-mother rather than a naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but if there be no ground for theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, it is ſtill the moſt Chriſtian and prudent way for the husband to be more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to his wife than unto his children when he is to ſet his houſe in order, and to make his Will: And for this we have a Chriſtian preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the practice of <hi>Elkanah.</hi> A very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Diuine (whom the Chriſtian world doth reverence for a very learned Expoſitor <note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

As a man that loves his wife would not only have her fare well when he is at home, but when abſent from home alſo: So if thou do love thy wife with a cordiall love thou wouldſt not only have her live well in this world whileſt thou art her companion here, but alſo when thou art, through the Lords free Grace a Companion with Saints and Angels in Heaven at the right hand of God, and in the boſome of thy deareſt Saviour. But if thou art not carefull to provide for thy wife as well as thou canſt whileſt thou liveſt here, thou canſt have but little hope that ſhe ſhould live well hereafter when thou art gone; which duty of thine if thou neglect, thou wilt leave a brand upon thy name to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to judge by, that thy wife never lay in the boſome of thy affections; for if ſhe had, thou wouldſt have expreſt more ſincere love to her at your parting. Thus God hath carried us through the conſideration of ten ſpecial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the husband doth owe unto his wife; which to help thy memory take the heads of them as they have been laid down in order, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, Conjugall Affections.

And among other ends ſhe was created for this, that is, to be his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. God found it not good for man to be alone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18. And indeed, how can ſhe be a meet helper to him if ſhe live apart from him. There may be many neceſſary occaſions for a man to change the place of his habitation, ſometimes to enjoy better meanes of Grace, ſometimes to enjoy better meanes of health, ſometimes to enjoy better means of livelihood, &amp; ſomtimes to enjoy ſociety of choiſe friends; there be none of theſe but may give a man a cleare call ſomtimes to remove his habitation, &amp; he muſt (if he be a Chriſtian) obey God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

wives (which they could not have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills) and <hi>Paul</hi> doth challenge the ſame priviledge as due to him as well as to the other. But to add a cleare demonſtration to this truth yet further by joyning preſidents to priviledges, conſider the practice of <hi>Sarah,</hi> when God cals <hi>Abraham</hi> to leave his country and go into that which he would ſhew him, ſhe goeth with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.5. When God cals him the ſecond time to remove, that is, to go into <hi>Egypt</hi> becauſe of the Famine in the Land where he did live, you ſhall find his wife did go with him, <hi>ver,</hi> 10, 11. who did alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1.

So muſt every Chriſtian wife ſay to her husband, where thou liveſt I will live, and where thou dieſt I will die, and there will I be buried, for nought but death ſhall part thee and me. By all which it doth (or may) appeare that it is the duty of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62199:70"/>
the wife to her husband to Cohabit with him in what place ſoever God ſhall call him; and if ſhe performe not this duty, ſhe diſables her ſelfe to the obſervation of others; But in caſe, firſt, that the husband will live in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Countrey, out of either a ſuperſtitious, or fantaſticall end or humour: The wife is not bound to follow him, for ſhe muſt look more after the true worſhip of God, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her own ſoule, than after any outward comfortable condition in the world. Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the Husband be an unbeliever, and doth not like to live with a believing wife, then ſuch a wife is at liberty (if I miſtake not the Apoſtle) to live from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13, 15. But laſtly, in caſe the husband do violate the Covenant of Marriage by Adultery, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then if the wife pleaſe ſhe may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, which by neceſſary conſequence may appeare from the words of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19 9. For if the husband may put his wife away for ſuch breach of Marriage-Contract, why not the wife put away her husband on the like occaſion. But if upon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſion the wife ſhall refuſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty to her husband, ſhe doth make void and null one ſpeciall end of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſo ſins againſt God the ordainer of that happy eſtate; alſo againſt her Husband, in depriving him of his due comfort; and laſtly, againſt her ſoule and conſcience, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſin and guilt; and againſt her body, in a violent cutting the thread of her chiefeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

            <p>In the third place,<note place="margin">The third duty of the VVife to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</note> the duty of the Wife to her Husband, is, to improve her ſpirituall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to be helpfull to him in the beſt things for the good of his ſoule, to ſtir him up to good duties when ſhe takes notice of any remiſs<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and carnall ſecurity in him; by ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and holy conference ſhe muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to quicken him againſt a ſpirituall Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which if it ſeize on him, will ſo becloud and benight his ſenſes, that he ſhall have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head nor heart, with any cheerefulneſſe of ſpirit, to walke with his God; which if his wife diſcerne him inclining to, (but in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner captivated under) ſhe had need to beſtir her ſelfe to ſalute him often with ſuch Texts of Scripture as theſe, <hi>viz.

(thou that art a Wife read the place, and follow the Precept.) She muſt labour to ſtrengthen her Husbands faith when he ſhews moſt weakeneſſe. After <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah</hi> had offered a ſacrifice to God, the Angell of the Lord did wonderfully in the preſence of him and his wife: The good Mans faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to faile, <hi>We ſhall dye,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe we have ſeen God,</hi> (want of faith was like to kill the poore man:) Now his wife ſteps in very

opportunely, and labours to ſtrengthen his faith, <hi>If,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>the Lord would have kill'd us he would not have told us theſe things, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted a Sacrifice at our hands. Judg.</hi> 13.20, 22, 23. ſo ſhe makes good that place in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Two are bettter than one, for if one fall the other will lift up his fellow: but woe be to him that is alone, for he hath not another to help him up.</hi> Truly, there is a marvellous Sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Husband and Wife in all conditions (I meane, when they live, and love together as man and wife) one will labour to ſupport ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And one thing let me put thee on in a ſpeciall manner, that is, be ſure as thou doſt deſire to improve thy gifts and parts for the good of thy Husbands ſoule.

            <p>Fourthly, The duty of a wife to her Husband,<note place="margin">The fourth duty of the VVife to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</note> is, a comely and Chriſtian-like ſubjection to him; ſhe muſt not contend for equality with him, much leſſe ſuperiority over him, but muſt content her ſelfe in the ſame ſtation or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein the God of wiſdom (or that God who is wiſdome it ſelfe) hath ſet her. Now that this is a duty, take Scripture evidence for it, (for I know it will not down, but ſticks in the throat with too too many, but to a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian a Command from God is enough to ſweeten that which to fleſh and bloud is as bitter as gall,) <hi>Col.</hi> 3.8. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your own Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as it is fit in the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your own huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands as unto the Lord;</hi> where marke the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of termes. In the former place it is, <hi>Wives ſubmit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as it is fit in the Lord:</hi> But in this latter, <hi>Wives ſubmit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as unto the Lord;</hi> For ſome women may ſay, we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſubmit our ſelves to our own Husbands as it is fit in the Lord; But what ſubmiſſion may be ſaid to be fit in the Lord? I anſwer,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62199:72"/>
That ſubmiſſion is fit in the Lord that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any Command the Husband ſhall lay on his wife which is grounded upon Scripture Precepts or Preſidents. Secondly, That ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Wives to their Husbands is fit in the Lord, which is not forbidden in Scripture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſly, nor implicitely, neither plainely, nor by neceſſary conſequence; but to anſwer ſuch as would pretend ſcrupuloſity, (when they intend only the diſcharging of themſelves from all ſubmiſſion to their Husbands,) let them ruminate or chew the end upon the laſt terme, where Wives are commanded to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their own Husbands as unto the Lord, and ſee what they can gather from thoſe words as a ground to ſatisfie their conſciences for their non-ſubmiſſion. Now becauſe the Holy Ghoſt did foreſee that women (nay, ſome good women) would not fall down before this truth, but endeavour to maintaine that rotten and unſound maxime, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Wife is the Husbands equall, therefore doth the Spirit of God in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. (which was laſt quoted) lay down an undeniable reaſon why Wives ſhould ſubmit to their Husbands, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Husband is the head of his Wife as Chriſt is the head of his Church;</hi> And then in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. the Spirit of God comes to a Corrollary or Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thus, <hi>Therefore as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt, ſo, let the Wives be unto their own Husbands in every thing.</hi> Now the reaſon here brought (for the end beforeſaid) ſtands thus, That as the Church doth ſubmit to Chriſts Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62199:72"/>
(he being her head,) ſo muſt the wife ſubmit to the Authority of her husband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the head likewiſe; and that he is ſo, conſider alſo that of the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The head of the woman is the man.</hi> Now Headſhip implies Authority, (that is beyond diſpute,) and Authority requires ſubjection. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher powers, whoſoever reſiſteth the power reſiſteth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation, Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. And none can deny but that Headſhip, Authority, and power is one and the ſame. Yet further, concerning this duty of the wife to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in relation to ſubjection to him; mind that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. where he ſaith, <hi>Likewiſe ye Wives be in ſubjection to your own Husbands.</hi> Then in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he brings you a Preſident for it, (and that from a ſingular woman,) <hi>Even as Sarai obeyed Abraham calling him Lord, whoſe Daughters you are as long as you do well.</hi> Now, as it is a glorious priviledge to be a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (in a ſpirituall ſenſe,) ſo it is a high honour to be a Daughter of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai.</hi> And thou who art a Chriſtian-woman, by no meanes forget, that from the originall of time God did ordaine that the Husband ſhould rule over his Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. Nay, the very Heathens thought it fit that every man ſhould beare rule in his own houſe, <hi>Heſter.</hi> 1.20, 22. But ſome woman may ſay, what if my husband be a Son of <hi>Belial?</hi> One who hath no grace in him? who beares not the Image of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62199:73"/>
God, but of the Devill? Muſt a Chriſtian be ſubject to a Heathen? A Saint to a Devill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate? I anſwer, that if thou be ſo match'd in the Marriage Eſtate, then thy condition is ſad, and very ſad, and much to be lamented. But ſtill it is a cleare truth, that thou muſt be ſubject to even ſuch a Husband in all his lawfull Commands, and further thou muſt not obey a godly husband;) And this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 3.1, 2. doth hint at plainely. <hi>Likewiſe ye wives be in ſubjection to your own Husbands;</hi> And then addes this as a reaſon to excite them to the performance of this duty, that is, That if any obey not the word, they alſo may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word be won by the Converſation of the wives, while they behold your chaſte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation coupled with feare. I ſee no cauſe to adde one word more to demonſtrate that ſubjection in a wife to her husband is a duty ſhe doth owe him. But let me beſeech thee that art a Husband, that all the Commands thou doſt lay on thy wife may be in the nature of requeſts and intreaties; for know it, that though thy wife be not equall to thee in power, yet ſhe is not ſo ſubordinate to thee as thy Children and Servants, command ſervice from them but deſire thy Wife to be ſubſervient to thee, and if ſhe have any commendable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in her thou maieſt be ſure thou haſt her heart to ſerve thee, and therefore canſt not want her hand. Nay, ſhe will rejoice that at any time ſhe hath any intimation of thy mind in any buſineſſe that ſhe is able to performe.</p>

muſt reverence her Husband in her words when ſhe ſpeakes of him to others; Firſt by giving him on all occaſions (that are juſt) due praiſe and commendations; And ſecondly, by being ready to vindicate his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt all unjuſt aſperſions &amp; Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that do impeach his credit, and obſtruct his well-deſerved Eſtimation in the hearts of ſuch as are wiſe and godly, whereby ſhe ſhall not only reverence him her ſelfe, but cauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the ſame. Secondly, The Wife muſt reverence her Husband in her Geſtures and Actions; Firſt, by giving him due reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others abroad, and before Children and Servants at home, not behaving her ſelfe in a rude and uncivill way toward him, as ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his preſence.

But in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this duty we ſhall uſe the more conciſeneſſe; having mentioned ſomething this way in the ninth duty of the Husband to his Wife, only what was there delivered was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Account, that is, to put it upon the Husband to ſtir up his Wife to avoid idleneſſe, and to labour to be induſtrious; where her chiefe Imployment was expreſt to be, to guide the houſe, and to looke well to the waies of her Family. But here we muſt labour to ſtir her up to the practice of this her duty, and we hope the convincing her that it is a duty will be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſufficient to that end. Now here it will be neceſſary for the Wife to take notice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.14. where he ſaith, <hi>I will</hi> (which is as much as to ſay I command) <hi>that the younger women marry,</hi> (beare Children) <hi>and guide the houſe.</hi> Now to guide the houſe, (at leaſt well, for that muſt be underſtood) is to ſee every ſervant performe their duty, and every one in the Family to have food in due ſeaſon, and that it be good for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and enough for quantity, and nothing ſpoyled for want of ſeaſonable ſpending; ſhe muſt have a jealous eye upon ſuch ſervants in whom there is the leaſt ground of ſuſpition of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62199:76"/>
unfaithfulneſſe, to prevent their paſſages out of the backe doore (as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay) and to take heed of laying temptations on them, by letting them enjoy any opportunities to come at ſuch things which concerne them not to have to do with but at times of waſhings, or cleanſing the corners of the houſe; for the Proverbe is, that the temptation makes the Thiefe. She muſt in a ſpeciall manner be carefull of the Education and breeding of the Children (they being the chiefeſt part of her Husbands, and her owne Eſtate;) ſhe muſt be as helpfull as ſhe may (if need require) to her Husband in his outward Calling. But thou that art a Wife, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to performe thy duty this way, then for thy imitation read often, and conſider ſeriouſly of the waies of the good Houſwife in <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.10. to the end of that Chapter. And truly, let me tell thee, that if thou be not conſciencious to further thy Husband in his outward eſtate, thou art very unworthy to have any ſhare in that honour of being reputed among the number of meet helpers. There hath many a man been raiſed to a good outward eſtate by the induſtry of his wife, for <hi>the hand of the diligent maketh rich, Prov.</hi> 10.4. (whether the hand of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Wife.) And many a man hath been brought to miſerable penury and beggery by the Idleneſſe (and ſuch qualities as attend thereon,) of his wife. Laſtly, The Wife may very much help her Husband in his outward Eſtate by labouring to prevent him, or to ſeeke to reclaime him from profuſe, unthrifty, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62199:76"/>
expenſive waies; I ſay, ſhe ſhould firſt labour to prevent him from ſuch Eſtate-conſuming courſes, which ſhe may do by labouring to provide all neceſſary and wholſome dyet at home for him, with due attendance and a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Family; for many a man having wanted theſe at home hath ſought them abroad, and ſo by little and little cuſtome in unthrifty courſes hath brought a neceſſity on him of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in them, a neceſſity indeed, but yet ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his own wicked heart. But thou that art a Wife, if thou canſt not prevent this plague from falling on thy Family, then in the ſecond place thou muſt labour in all waies of wiſdome and ſweetneſſe to reclaime him out of theſe pernitious courſes. Beſeech him to conſider his ſin (by this wicked way of his) againſt God; Secondly, againſt his own ſoule; Thirdly, againſt his body by unhealthfulneſſe and noyſome diſeaſes; Fourthly, againſt his Credit; Fifthly, Againſt his owne Eſtate; Sixthly, Againſt thy ſelfe. Laſtly, Againſt his poore Children. Thou muſt alſo labour to be as amiable in his eye as poſſible, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thy company; (truly, they are no good meanes that ſome women uſe to reclaime their Husbands by, as to follow them with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged ſpirit to an Ale-houſe, and there to raile, and foame, pull, and teare, as if they would throw the houſe out of the window (as we ſay) for this courſe ſeldome or never doth do any good.) But if all the meanes thou canſt uſe prove in vaine, beg of God to ſanctifie this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62199:77"/>
ſore afflicton to thee and thine, and the more expenſive thy Husband is abroad, the more ſparing be thou at home, that if poſſible the Eſtate may hold out to be a meanes to bring up thy Children, untill (under God) they can ſhift by good waies for themſelves. But for thy own condition, whether in ſuch a deſperate caſe thou maieſt make a purſe for thy ſelfe (as we ſay) or not, I ſhall ſay very little, (and that under correction too, ſubmitting to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of learned and judicious Divines,) but I am fully ſatisfied in my own conſcience, that thou maieſt not (contrary to thy Husbands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance) lay by one penny (as we lay) againſt a wet day; and the reaſon why I thus thinke, is, becauſe thy Husband alone hath the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Eſtate, unleſſe ſome agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you before Marriage, or betweene thy friends and him have altered the caſe. And we muſt for ever walke by this Rule, that we <hi>muſt not do evill that good may come thereby, Rom.</hi> 3.8. for their damnation is juſt. But this thou muſt do, (and in ſo doing approve thy ſelfe a Chriſtian.) thou muſt act faith on God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. And that thou canſt not do if thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect lawfull meanes, or uſe any that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>

               <note place="margin">The eighth duty of the VVife to the Husband.</note>Now in the eighth and laſt place, the duty of the Wife to her Husband, is, to put forth her ſelfe with all tenderneſſe and endeared Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, with all readineſſe, enlargedneſſe, and cheerefulneſſe, to yield him comfort and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in the time of bodily affliction, ſickneſſe,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62199:77"/>
and weakneſs, (we have ſeen before, that the aiming at comfort in all conditions is one end (and a principall one too) of our deſiring the Marriage condition.) And if a woman be any way negligent herein, ſhe doth leave unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed one ſpeciall duty ſhe doth owe to her Husband; for if ever a man ſtand in need of his Wives help, he doth ſo in a ſpeciall manner when he cannot help himſelfe. Now the time of ſickneſſe and weakeneſſe is ſuch a time, and then the wife muſt in an extraordinary way put forth her beſt abilities in her own perſon to contribute to the foreſaid purpoſe; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but ſhe muſt labour to procure able and faithfull attendants about him; and by no meanes neglect to look out to procure (under God) help from ſuch Phyſitians as have both the Theory &amp; practique part of their profeſſion, and manifeſt moſt tenderneſſe, care, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty for the good and recovery of their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. But what meanes ſoever ſhe makes uſe of, ſhe muſt depend on the God of meanes for a bleſſing, which ſhe muſt crave of him by earneſt and fervent prayer, for ſuch prayer is a meanes ſanctified of God to ſave the ſick, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15. We ſhall turne in here, and proceed no further to lay down the particular duties that the Wife doth owe to her Husband, of which ſhe muſt make conſcience as in the preſence of God. And that as ſhe will approve her ſelfe to be a meet helper to her Husband; the number of which duties you ſee are eight, firſt, Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall love; Secondly, Cohabitation; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

To be helpfull to him in the beſt things for the good of his ſoule; Fourthly, Submiſſion to him; Fifthly, To reverence him; Sixthly, To labour to beare with his Infirmities; Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To yield him furtherance in his outward Eſtate; Eighthly, and laſtly, To labour to help and comfort him in time of Ilneſſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any kind.</p>
            <p>We have endeavoured hitherto to conſider of the diſtinct duties of the Husband to his Wife: And of the VVives duties to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; or which duties ſome that the Husband doth owe unto his VVife are the ſame that the VVife doth owe unto her Husband: And ſome that the VVife doth owe unto her Husband are the ſame that the Husband doth owe unto his VVife, yet with ſome apparent differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>But now there remaines ſome duties to be conſidered of that are equally due to each other, (though not before propoſed) and muſt be ſo handled.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The firſt joynt duty between a man and wife.</note>The firſt joint duty betweene man and wife equally obliging both, is, that they labour to maintaine a good opinion one of another touching their faithfulneſs in keeping the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Covenant, and that neither of them have violated the ſame by lodging their hearts in the boſome of ſtrangers, or defiling their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with them; For, if for want of care here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there appeare ground of juſt ſuſpition of unfaithfulneſſe, jealouſie will get into the heart, and take up its reſidence there untill it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62199:78"/>
have conſumed the ſap, and devoured the root of all true love; And then miſerable daies in all probability will be the portion of both as long as their unhappy lives laſt. Marke how <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the <hi>Canticles</hi> doth deſcribe jealouſie, <hi>Jealouſie is cruell as the grave, the coales there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are coales of fire which have a moſt vehement flame, Eccl.</hi> 8.6. this fire will not admit of any limits. I ſay againe, it will eat out love, it will conſume joy and all comfort in the Marriage-Eſtate; yea, it will waſte the fleſh, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and the bone, and ſhorten life it ſelfe. Jealouſie, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, is the rage of a man: therefore he will not ſpare in the day of vengeance. He will not regard a Ranſome; neither will he reſt content though thou giveſt many gifts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.34, 35. Of all wrongs that can be offered to man, or wife, they will not endure this breach of the Conjugall Contract; good natures (eſpecially gracious hearts) in man and wife will beare with the Infirmities of each other, but they will not be patient when they ſee this curſed enormity. Here then you ſee that this care that is to be taken by both parties to labour to preſerve in their hearts a good opinion of each other this way, may well fall in as a duty to be minded of exceeding high concernment.</p>
            <p>The ſecond joint duty between man and wife equally concerning both, is,<note place="margin">The ſecond joynt duty betweene a man and wife.</note> the yielding to each other due benevolence; the Apoſtle expreſſely requires it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3. and gives an undeniable reaſon for it in <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and in <hi>ver.</hi> 5.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62199:79"/>
he tels us (upon the matter) that to deny the ſame each to other, is, to defraud each other, but I refer you to the place and will not adde one ſyllable more on this point for ſpeciall reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third joynt duty between a man and Wife.</note>The third and laſt joint duty of man and wife equally concerning both, is, that they do not pollute or defile the Marriage bed, for it may be polluted <hi>&amp;c.</hi> two waies. Firſt, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinateneſſe; Secondly, by unſeaſonableneſs. Firſt, by Inordinateneſſe, when Married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons abuſe their liberty in Marriage-Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to exceſſe, and ſo make it a meanes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to encreaſe Concupiſcence than to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame; they ſhould caſt on water to quench luſt, and not Oyle to enflame the fury thereof. God hath ordained Marriage as a meanes to avoid Fornication, but this exceſſe we ſpeake of, makes (even) ſuch perſons more obnoxious to temptations to that ſin, than hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily moſt are that are in the ſingle condition. And God doth many times ſeverely puniſh this ſin, but the Philoſopher will tell you how; He will acquaint you, that by this inordinate and over-frequent actings you do evacuate the beſt ſpirits which God and Nature hath not only appointed for generation, but for the ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the body of man, which otherwiſe would be full of Imbecillity, but being ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely caſt away there followeth much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the body, raging paines in the head, and ſometimes that exceeding ſad affliction of the running of the Reines, and ſometimes the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62199:79"/>
effect of theſe diſtempers brings death. Now it is true, both ſexes are not joint ſufferers alike, but they are joint ſinners, and ſhould jointly be humbled and reformed. Thus much for the firſt head; but ſecondly, the Marriage-bed may be polluted by uſing it in unſeaſonable times; for there are two times that God doth prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite theſe conjunctions in; Firſt, in caſe the Lord call us to the duty of Faſting and Prayer, then there muſt be a ceſſation and intermiſſion this way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 5. <hi>Defraud not one another except with conſent for a time, that you may give your ſelves to Faſting and prayer.</hi> The Lord alſo by the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> requires the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome to go forth of his Chamber in the day of humiliation, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15, 16. VVhen the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God make their approaches before the Lord on extraordinary occaſions there muſt be very ſerious preparations to ſuch duties; And as jewels and rich apparrell muſt be laid aſide in ſome caſes, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4, 5, 6. So upon ſome other approaches they muſt not come at their wives, <hi>Exo.</hi> 19.15. Thus much for the firſt unſeaſonable time, whereby the Marriage-bed is polluted. But ſecondly, In a ſpeciall manner this ſin may be committed in thoſe ordinary ſeaſons of extraordinary flux, or over-flowings of nature in the Feminine gender, for then the Lord hath forbidden all neere approaches in ſuch a way as we ſpeake to, and that under a ſpeciall penalty: even the being cut off from their people, which was either by death, or caſtings out from Church-ſociety, (to the later
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62199:80"/>
I encline,) <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.18. and in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.10. the Lord complaines that in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> there were a very flagitious people this way. Now then, by theſe pollutions of the Marriage-bed, firſt, by Inordinateneſſe; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Unſeaſonableneſſe, the opinion of an Orthodoxe Divine will be confirmed, which is, that as a man may be a drunkard with his own drinke, and a glutton with his own meat, ſo a man may be a filthy and uncleane perſon with his own wife. And for the ſin of theſe laſt perſons defiling the Marriage-bed by their unnaturall and uncleane Conjunctions, God doth puniſh it (according to the obſervation of the Philoſopher) with an unhealthfull and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Off-ſpring. And for ought thou knoweſt with ſpirituall judgements on thy ſoule, even hardneſſe of heart, and finall Impenitency. Therefore in the name and feare of the great God it concernes you both to keep at a far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from theſe pollutions in the Marriage-condition. This may ſuffice for theſe three laſt and joint duties concerning both man &amp; wife; Firſt, to avoid the giving any cauſe for jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to enter into the heart; Secondly, the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each other due benevolence; And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a religious care to ſhun all pollution in the Marriage-bed, either by Inordinateneſſe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonableneſſe in the uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>We are now by the Lords good leave and divine aſſiſtance to proceed to the laſt thing (propounded in the beginning,) which we are to conſider of before Marriage, namely, the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62199:80"/>
duties that both Husband and Wife do owe unto their Family in relation to both Children and Servants. Which becauſe moſt of theſe duties concerne both Husband and VVife, we ſhall endeavour to handle them together for brevities ſake, yet make ſome diſtinction, that they may both take notice of their duties, where diſtinction is to be made.</p>

            <p>The ſecond duty that both man and wife do
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62199:81"/>
owe unto their Children and Servants, is to pray with them, and for them. Ye have ſeen but now that Parents muſt take paines to teach and inſtruct their Children and Servants in the knowledge of God; But what ſucceſſe can there be expected as the bleſſed fruit of ſuch a duty without prayer with, and for them? <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the encreaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. But this encreaſe muſt be humbly ſought of God by Prayer. There is a ſpirit of Indotionableneſſe in all by nature, but it doth abound many times in ſome Children and Servants. <hi>I will inſtruct and teach thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) in the way thou ſhalt go: I will guid thee with mine eye, Pſal.</hi> 32.8. Then inſtantly adds in the very next verſe, <hi>Be ye not as the horſe or Mule which have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. There is a great deale of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and blockiſh ſtupidity in all ſorts of perſons, (and therefore in Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,) which none but God can take away; it was God that opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſhe attended to the things that were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 16.14. Therefore there is great need to pray unto God to take away all obſtacles that may obſtruct the edification of thy Family in ſaving knowledge, and Grace, or elſe thou maieſt have ſmall hopes of doing them any good by all thy other paines in the diſcharging thy duties. Mind the imprecation of <hi>Jeremy, Poure out thy wrath</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon the Heathen, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name, Jer.</hi> 10.25. Holy <hi>Job</hi> was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62199:82"/>
very conſcientious in this duty of prayer for his, <hi>Job</hi> 1.15. He offereth burnt Offerings to God in relation to his Sons and Daughters; with which duty the Learned do conclude he offered Prayer, and of that there can be no doubt, becauſe when he offered burnt Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for his three Friends, he alſo prayed for them, <hi>Job</hi> 42.7, 8, 10. <hi>David</hi> he praies for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.19. And can any with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conclude that he did not pray for his other Children upon all Occaſions? A very groſſe abſurdity it were ſo to do; Certainly we may deſiſt from further proſecution of this point as to Information, that it is the duty of Parents to pray with, and for their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, (becauſe all men will confeſſe it;) but for their neglect of it we ſhall by the help of God (in due place) labour to meet with them by juſt reproofe. But for ſuch as are godly Children and Servants, who take notice of the extreame remiſſeneſſe of their Parents and Maſters in performing this, demonſtrating evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that they are Chriſtians by praying for them; I exhort that they would themſelves go to God in ſecret, to beg of him to open the eyes of ſuch Governours to ſee with godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row this their abominable ſin, and to give them grace to reforme it, leſt ſuch Governour of Families ſinke into the bottomleſſe pit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if this gentle meanes will not prevaile with them, thou muſt ſharpely reprove them, <hi>that they may be ſound in the faith, Tit.</hi> 1.15.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62199:84"/>
notice of this alſo, that the procraſtination, or putting off of Correction of your Children, will but fit them to be incorrigible; the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trees whilſt they are young is a ſimilitude often on this occaſion made uſe of, but too ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome practiſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth his Rod hateth his Son; but he that loveth him correcteth him betimes.</hi> Prov. 23.23, 24. <hi>With-hold not Correction from the Child; for if thou beat him with the Rod, he ſhall not dye; thou ſhalt beat him with the Rod, and ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his ſoul from hell.</hi> But in making uſe of this Ordinance of Correction, whether of Children or Servants, obſerve with care theſe three things: Firſt, a fit time; Secondly, that your ends be good; and laſtly, that it be in a right manner. Firſt, for a fit time: which time is, when the heat of Paſſion is over; for we muſt be juſt in the meaſure of Correction, which we cannot be if Paſſion have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Paſſion may provoke us to play the Tyrants, and to make the party corrected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in our eyes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.3. And that will diſhearten and deject them. In the ſecond place, propoſe a right end in correcting any under your charge, you muſt not give correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to manifeſt your Authority, or to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on them for croſſing you, but ſincerely to kill ſinne in them, to ſubdue their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant luſt, to make them more ſit to glorifie God, and perform ſervice unto men: theſe and ſuch like ought to be purely your aimes. And laſtly, you muſt adminiſter this Ordinance in a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62199:85"/>
a right manner; that is, with lifting up your hearts to God, deſiring him with the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vouchſafe to them Inſtruction, to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it to them, ſo that it may prove effectuall for their Reformation, to make them obedient to God in word and deed, and faithtull in the diſcharge of all the duties they owe unto you. Now when your carriage is truely thus in your correcting Children or Servants, you may (by the bleſſing of God) expect ſome gracious effects of it, except the Lord have a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with, and againſt them, to harden their hearts, by this (and other means) to their own perdition.</p>
            <p>Thus we have done with the foure general Duties which both Husband and wife owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both Children and Servants: as firſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the wayes of God. Secondly, to pray with them, and for them. Thirdly, to walk before them in good examples. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and laſtly, to ſeek to reclaim them from bad wayes. Now becauſe the neglect of theſe Duties is a prime cauſe of infinite diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, the means of many ſouls peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing to all eternity, and the breeding of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of rotten and vile members in Church and State, we ſhall endeavour with the Lords Aſſiſtance, to proceed to ſome reaſons, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the performance of theſe Duties by all godly Governours, and then come to make ſome Application thereof.</p>

We have a good proverbe applicable here, that is, Uſe legs and have legs; and thou ſaieſt thy parts are weake; if thou canſt not pray with thy Family but in a very weake manner, then I ſay, pray to God to teach thee to pray, pray in ſecret for both the ſpirit and gift of prayer, that thou maieſt be able to Performe it in thy Family; but beware thou ſet not too high a rate on the gift of prayer, for it often goes alone without the Spirit; thou wert better of the two have the Spirit of Prayer than the gift, but both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth beſt, (eſpecially in relation to edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others.) <hi>Simon Magus</hi> deſired to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a power to give the Holy Ghoſt to whom he pleaſed, his ends were baſe, as well as his tender vile; he did aime (as good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines thinke) at popular applauſe, beſides a curſed gaine.

I ſee a gift of prayer, (yea, and of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching too) and a ſpirit of predominant pride, I muſt take the liberty to think of ſuch a man as I do apprehend cleare ground for. This laſt paſſage I do inſert for this end principally, to take off the inordinate affections of any poore ſoule from the gift of prayer; ſincerity in all thy walkings with God will comfort thee in the midſt of all defects; and what knoweſt thou (deare Chriſtian) but God will joine his ſtrength with thy weakneſſe, and make thee an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrument of begetting ſoules to God as well as bodies, and ſo make thee (in a ſenſe) a ſpirituall Father as well as a bodily, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thee at the laſt day to ſay to God, Behold here am I, and the Children whom thou haſt given me; where we may allude to that which the Apoſtle applies and makes proper to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. Now in the laſt place, (for it de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerves no other) by thy religious care to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy Children and Servants in the waies of God thou maieſt make ſuch Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants very profitable to thee in outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was no profitable ſervant to his Maſter when he was graceleſſe, but after he was converted he tels <hi>Philemon</hi> that now he was profitable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 11. There is much crying out in the world (and not without cauſe) againſt ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, diſobedient, and undutifull Children; and againſt refractory, and unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; But may not the neglect of Parents and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62199:94"/>
Maſters about making their Children (in the uſe of meanes) Gods Children, and their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants by the foreſaid meanes the ſervants of God; may not I ſay, this be a ſpeciall cauſe of all this confuſion; doubtleſſe yea, for it is juſt with God that when thou wilt not make thy Children and Servants to anſwer Gods ends, (at leaſt ſo far as poſſible thou maieſt) that thy owne ſhould be wholly fruſtrate. Thus much for the uſes.</p>
            <p>Beloved, be pleaſed to remember that we have urged Parents and Maſters to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of divers duties both to Children and Servants jointly together, but that thoſe duties did relate to the good of their ſoules only; but now there remaine ſome duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to their outward good; and becauſe ſome of them have reference to Children par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in which Servants can make no claime: And ſome others do belong to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, (but I cannot ſay peculiarly, becauſe Children have an intereſt in them,) we ſhall therefore endeavour to advance toward the handling of them likewiſe, (leaning on God for aſſiſtance;) In order whereunto we ſhall labour to give Children the precedency, for Grace and Nature doth teach the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The 1 duty of Parents to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note>The firſt duty which Parents owe unto their Children, in relation to their outward Eſtate, is, to further them in the meanes for their attaining of a competent meaſure of Learning for ſuch condition and ſtate of life as God ſhall call them to, whether in Church

An illiterate man can receive no content in himſelfe, neither can he be profitable to others; a man without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is like a man who hath but halfe an eye, he ſeeth divers things, but in a confuſed and rude forme, even men walking like trees, like him in the Goſpell, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.24. but he that hath good eies diſcernes things in a tranſparent way, to the great ſatisfaction of his mind; ſo a man without Learning ſees things that have much beauty in themſelves, but to him they are cloathed and ſhadowed in darke and black colours, he ſees nothing but an outſide, whereas he who hath Learning ſeeth through and through them (as we ſay;) he hath a diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing knowledge of them, he can anatomize them, and dive into the nature of them, he can gaine by every Creature, and ſqueeze out the quintiſcence and benefit of every Calling; he can improve all times, all changes, and all things to his advantage.

inſtances, what <hi>Moſes</hi> was for learning, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 7.22. And what he was in publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the Scriptures will demonſtrate, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God he was the moſt eminent deliverer of the Church from a ſtate of bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that any Age ſince the Creation can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and therefore is ſaid to be King in <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run</hi> when the heads of the people, and Tribes of Iſrael were gathered together, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.5. It is ſaid of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the other three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that God gave them knowledge and skill in all Learning, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.17. Then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. they were preferred to ſtand before the King; and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2 48, 49. they were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higheſt places for command in the whol Province of <hi>Babylon.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was the moſt learned man, being brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> which was a place of learning, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.3. And all men know he was the moſt eminent amongſt them for parts and paines, and himſelfe doth modeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that he was not a whit behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. and for paines he did outſtrip them all, for he wrote more Epiſtles to the Churches than all the other, and ſhewed more Rhetorick in that ſhort Epiſtle of his to <hi>Philemon</hi> than you ſhall meet with in large Volumes. Truly, he had greater gifts then they who boaſt of the ſpirit, (but what ſpirit they are led by is not hard to gueſſe at;) and yet he prizeth his books as well as his Parchments (which Parchments were as ſome conceive ſome ſermon Notes,) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62199:95"/>
But if it be objected that it is not of neceſſity to give Children more learning then the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which they are like to be put into doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; nor ſecondly, to give them more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than their Parents eſtate can beare; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is true, there is no neceſſity for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to have much Learning to help them in managing ſome meane and common Callings, but it is neceſſary in any Calling to be able to read in their mother-tongue (as we ſay) and to write to, but had they more it would be no burden to them; it might fit them for ſociety and choice diſcourſe with thoſe of higher bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than themſelves, for in perſons of the greateſt parts there would be ſome conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention to thoſe leſſe parted. And alſo true it is Parents are not tyed to ruine themſelves, nor any of their Children, to breed up others great Schollers, And yet I could heartily wiſh that Parents would ſtrive to give their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren good breeding this way, though it ſhould be their greateſt outward portions. I have been the larger in this particular, becauſe it may be obſerved frequently that there are ſome who are very rich men, but yet ſo glew'd to their curſed earthly-mindedneſſe that they will ſpare nothing (or very little) to give their Children learning; they may leave them good eſtates whereby they may wear good cloathes, but all that know them may point at them, and ſay, they are the arranteſt clownes, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt bred fellows in, or neare, the places where they dwell; It was falſely ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62199:96"/>
               <hi>much learning did make him mad, Act</hi> 126.24. But it may be truly ſaid that ſuch perſons as we ſpeake of, for want of Learning they are the unuſefulleſt perſons of any to be Inſtrumentall for the good of Church or Common-wealth, and their Parents deſerve the leaſt reſpect of all others in the places where they live. And therefore thou who art a Parent mind it, that it is thy duty in a ſpeciall manner to thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to vouchſafe them the meanes of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and be carefull to diſcharge thy duty herein.</p>

And it is ſomewhat probable that our Saviour himſelf, before he entred into his Miniſteriall Office, did work at his Fathers Trade, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.3.

And therefore it is the duty of Parents to labour to provide for their Children honeſt and lawfull Callings; but in your endeavours this way let me adviſe you to take care of three things: Firſt, Be carefull to gaine for them ſuch Maſters as feare the Lord, for elſe thou maieſt feare that all thy paines thou haſt taken with them for the good of their ſoules may be loſt. Secondly, Be carefull to put them to ſuch Callings as they are moſt capable of. Some Hiſtories report, that the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would put their Children to any Calling, would firſt bring them into a large Roome (which they did furniſh with all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers tooles) and if there they did take up any toole and ſeeme to take delight therein, they would put them to that Calling unto which the ſame did belong. Thirdly and laſtly, thou muſt take care to put them to ſuch Callings as require no more ſtock of money to mannage them than thou art like to leave to them, for elſe when their Time is out they can make no benefit by their Trades, unleſſe they remaine in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62199:97"/>
a ſtate of ſervitude by working under others. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Art thou called a Servant, care not for it,</hi> (that is, be not dejected therefore) <hi>but if thou maiſt be free, uſe it rather,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. And then in the 23. verſe he addes, <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not ſervants of men.</hi> Therefore thou that art a Parent, let thy care be ſuch for thy children, that thou make them ſervants to others but for a convenient time, that after they may live in a free and honourable way.</p>

               <note place="margin">The firſt outward duty that Maſters owe to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note>The next thing in order to what was firſt propounded, is, to conſider what duties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Families doe owe unto their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for their outward comfortable ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And,</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it is the duty of Maſters, &amp;c. to provide for their ſervants wholſome, and well-conditioned Meat and Drink, in due time, and ſufficient of that too: as alſo lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waſhing, and what elſe is neceſſary for to maintain life and livelihood. In order to which, the wife muſt take notice that the chief care of this, in reference to the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and the well-ordering of all things herein, concerns her ſelfe. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt puts upon record the practice of the good Huſwife in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31.15. of whom it is ſaid, <hi>That ſhe riſeth whilſt it is yet Night, and giveth meat to her Houſhold, and a portion unto her Maids:</hi> For doubtleſſe the comfortable allowance of theſe things is one ſpeciall means (by the bleſſing of God) to maintain health, and to make them able and ſtrong in body, and chearfull in mind, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch ſervice as is required of them. But if it pleaſe the Lord to viſit them with ſickneſs or lameneſs in body or limbs, and thereby to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62199:98"/>
abate ſtrength and vigour of body and ſpirit, then it is the duty of their Maſters and Dames to look out in the uſe of means for their recovery, to make uſe both of Phyſitians and Phyſick, and all helps Providence may provide for comfort under affliction, and reſtoration to health again. <hi>Naaman</hi> a ſervant to the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> being afflicted by the Plague of Leproſie, his Maſter writes a letter in his behalfe to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſends it by the hand of <hi>Naaman,</hi> in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his health again, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.5. The good Centurion we read of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.6, 8. when his ſervant was ſick of the Palſie, and grievouſly tormented, he goes in perſon to Jeſus Chriſt, (who was a Phyſitian both for body and ſoul) and humbly beſeecheth him for his ſervants cure, and through the free grace of Chriſt obtains it: its good to goe to God in the firſt place for ſupplyes of all the wants of our ſelves and our relations;) <hi>Hee that is in miſery ought to bee comforted of his neighbour,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation) <hi>Job</hi> 6.14. Now if Neighbours muſt put forth themſelves to comfort (or relieve and help) ſuch as are in any miſery. How much more muſt Governours of Families la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to perform this duty to their ſick and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered ſervants, (the inference is undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) <hi>A good man is mercifull to his beaſt,</hi> ſaith one Tranſlation; And another ſaith, <hi>A righteous man regardeth the life of his Beaſt, Proverbs</hi> 12.10. And how much better is a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62199:99"/>
man than a ſheep? <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.12. But it is much to be bewailed, that many ſervants who have in their health and ſtrength well diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their duties to their Maſters, yet find ſmall comfort and regard from them when the hand of God is fallen upon them: for they are then either ſent home to their poor and indigent Parents to take care after, or elſe mued up in a hole, and ſmall attendance, and leſſe allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of means for their good provided for them: ſuch Governours of Families are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and hard-hearted perſons; and pity it is, that ever good ſervants ſhould ſtep over their Threſholds to ſerve them; for ſuch have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercy nor juſtice in them, neither grace nor good nature: And yet of this ſtamp and hell-bred crew, there are great ſwarms: but let them take heed, (God is juſt) their owne children be not ſo ſerved, when they are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to others, but I wiſh them better ſpeed. We might here adde a Word concerning ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Recreations to be allowed to ſervants, for they may ſtand in great need of them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, after long and ſore labour, to quicken their ſpirits, and to enliven them with all ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity to return to their imployment, (we ſay, <hi>Whet is no let:</hi>) And without doubt, if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters would grant it them, they would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gainers by in the quick and wel-managing their buſineſſes, than loſers. But when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters grant this liberty as before ſaid, I would adviſe them to take much care that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations allowed, be lawfull, the time ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62199:99"/>
and their ſervants company civill, or elſe both Maſters and ſervants may repent, the one that they gave the liberty: and the other that they ſo ill improved the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, it is the duty of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond outward duty that Maſters owe to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> to allow their ſervants ſufficient wages for their labour, and to pay it to them when it is due.

That were abſurd to thinke; would you that are Maſters have your ſervants barely live? You would not like that if you would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to put your ſelves in their condition.

The Labourer is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62199:100"/>
worthy of his hire, Luk.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Maſters give unto your ſervants that which is juſt and equall, Col.</hi> 4.1. <hi>James</hi> tels you, that <hi>the detaining wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from Labourers cryeth, and the cries of them are entred into the cares of the Lord of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, James</hi> 5.4. And ſurely when ever the Lord gives an eare to cries, whether the cry of Innocent bloud, as that of <hi>Abel, Gen.</hi> 4.10. or any other occaſion, ſome fearfull vengeance doth fall upon the heads of ſuch as cauſe them to aſcend; and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> bids thoſe worldlings houle for thoſe miſeries that ſhould come upon them.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third duty of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to their Servants.</note>In the third and laſt place, the dutie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to their ſervants, is, to be liberall to them at times of parting, in caſe they have been ſervants a conſiderable time, and have been diligent and faithfull, and ſo a bleſſing to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.12, 13, 14. <hi>So Prov.</hi> 17.2. There be many Maſters who are ſtrangers to this duty, even in the knowledge of it, and more in the practice thereof. Yet ſome (I dare not ſay in conſcience to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty, but rather from the freeneſſe of their nature,) doe upon the matter that which is equivalent hereunto, namely thoſe, that if their ſervants part from them by Marriage will give them beneficiall wedding dinners, and ſometimes divers peeces of neceſſary houſhold-ſtuffe, which is a great advantage to them; and this is ſo laudable a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62199:100"/>
thing that I could wiſh all would more pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the ſame, provided, they prevent all abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſſe of the Creature by luxury, and exceſs, and diſorder of every kind at ſuch meetings. Thus you ſee that Governours of Families do owe three duties to their ſervants, in relation to their outward conditions. Firſt, to allow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them meat, drinke, and all other neceſſaries for their comfortable ſubſiſtance. Secondly, to yield them ſufficient wages. And laſtly, to be liberall to them at time of parting.</p>
            <p>And thus by the gracious aſſiſtance of God we have finiſhed all that was propoſed at firſt to be conſidered of by ſuch as deſire to enter into the Marriage eſtate, relating to the duties which each perſon in that condition of life owe one to another, and both of them to ſuch as God ſhall ſet under them, <hi>viz.</hi> to children and ſervants. But here it will be of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to take notice of what duty children and ſervants owe unto Parents and Maſters, that they may call upon them to performe the ſame; where we ſhall firſt obſerve the duties Children owe unto their Parents, and then the duties of Servants to their Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place it is the duty of Children to yield unto their Parents all due Reverence and Honour;<note place="margin">The firſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Children owe unto their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> this duty is expreſly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother;</hi> which the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2. takes notice of to be the firſt Commandement with promiſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 6.6. A ſon honoureth his Father: <hi>If I be a Father where is my honour?</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:62199:101"/>
But how ſhould this Honour and Reverence be expreſt may ſome ſay? I anſwer, firſt, in words; Secondly, in actions and geſtures. Firſt, in words, Children muſt reverence their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents by uſing few words in their Parents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or hearing; Silence for the generall well becomes the younger ſort before the Elder, but more properly Children before their Parents. And when they ſpeake to them they muſt make uſe of the choiceſt expreſſion that may be to hold forth their dutifull reſpect by. And for their Action too, they muſt be full of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, as riſing up before them, and ſtanding in their preſence if they expect it, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſo long as they think fit, and making obeyſance on all occaſions, by ſhewing all fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Child-like diſpoſitions to them, by harkening to all their grave Counſels and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions with diligent attention, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1. As alſo by ſubmitting, and ſubjecting themſelves to all their godly reprehenſions, and by treading in their religious ſteps, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their unblameable examples, and by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering all their imperfections and weakneſſes, as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> did when their Father lay drunke and naked in his Tent. <hi>Solomon</hi> is a ſingular example of honouring his Mother in another kind, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond duty of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Parents.</note>In the ſecond place, it is the duty of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to obey their Parents in all things lawfull, and that with all readineſſe. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord, Eph.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Children obey your Parents in all things, for this is well pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

The <hi>Rechabus</hi> obey <hi>Jonadab</hi> their Father in things that required a great deale of ſelfe-deniall, <hi>Ier.</hi> 35.5, 6, 7. which the Lord rewards them for in <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. A Biſhop muſt rule his own houſe well, and have his Children in ſubjection, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. Now ſubjection of all Children to Parents is as much a duty as it is in the children of the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.

Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt not make their own wils a rule of their actions, but the Commandements of God, and the Precepts of their Parents that are not contrary to the revealed will of God; they muſt alſo quietly ſubmit to ſuch correction as they ſhall think fit to inflict on them for their faults.</p>

preſerve her Father, and her Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the duty of Children to relieve their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in their want; conſider what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4. That to requite our Parents is good and acceptable before God. When Parents have been at great paines and charge to bring up their Children, and then come to poverty, (which perhaps may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſuch charge.) it is not only againſt grace, but againſt good nature too, to caſt them off without due care to relieve them; it was the peſtilent doctrine of the Phariſees to maintaine that Children were diſcharged from their duty herein, provided, they did offer a gift at the Altar (which was indeed but to fill their pouches,) <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13. Which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of theirs, as well as their doctrine, our Saviour there condemnes. We may learne a better example from the practice of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when he was in proſperity, and his Fathers houſe in want, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.11, 12. For he nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his Father and his whole Family in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſes,</hi> which was the moſt fertile place of all <hi>Egypt.</hi> When <hi>Naomi</hi> returned very poore out of the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> into the Land of Iſrael, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.21. then her Daughter in Law wrought hard, and tooke great paines to gaine proviſion for her maintenance. God condemnes the formall faſts of the Children of Iſrael, as for other things, ſo for this, that <hi>they did hide themſelves from their own fleſh, Iſa.</hi> 58.6, 7. Now Parents may be more truly ſaid to be our own fleſh than others in common can be ſaid
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62199:102"/>
to be; our Saviour in that place of <hi>Marke</hi> makes it one kind of honouring Parents to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them in their want; and to honour our Parents you have it proved before to be a duty from children. There be other duties which children owe unto their Parents, but they may be included in theſe: If theſe be conſcientiouſly performed they will be all diſcharged. The duties then which children owe unto their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which are obvious to your eye, are, firſt, to reverence them. Secondly, to obey them. Thirdly, to labour to preſerve them from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to maintaine them in their wants.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, we are to proceed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe the duties which ſervants owe unto their Maſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then we ſhall draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this poore Treatiſe, and ſo leave all upon your hearts to practice in your lives.</p>
            <p>The firſt duty that ſervants owe unto their Maſters,<note place="margin">The firſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters, &amp;c.</note> is the ſame that children owe to their Parents, that is, Honour and Reverence; this duty all Inferiours owe to their Superiours, and therefore it muſt be a duty here; Now that it is ſo, conſider the fore quoted place, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. A ſon honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſter: <hi>If I be a Maſter</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>where is my feare,</hi> (or Reverence?) Implying that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence is a duty ſervants owe to their Maſters, and that they are obliged to the performance of it. That place in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. is much to be obſerved for this purpoſe, where the Apoſtle requires all ſervants that are under the yoke to count their own Maſters worthy of all
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62199:103"/>
honour, and then adds a reaſon for the ſame, which is this, <hi>That the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>med;</hi> Then it is very cleare that ſuch ſervants as make no conſcience to performe this duty of giving honour to their Maſters do expoſe the name and word of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God to contempt, and to be blaſphemed; and how ſhall ſuch ſervants ever be able to anſwer for this ſin of theirs before the great and all-powerfull God, who is alwaies armed with divine vengeance to be powred down upon the heads and hearts of ſuch as are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this kind; and ſuch are all ſervants that diſcharge not the duty here mentioned. Now if ſervants would know how, and in what way this duty ſhould be performed, for their help therein I refer them to thoſe means briefly nominated for direction to children in the performance of this very duty to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and by the way it is worth obſerving, that in a reall and true ſence it may be ſaid, and proved, that Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Parents to then ſervants as well as to their children, yet with a great deale of difference.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place it is the duty of ſervants to be obedient unto their Maners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This duty hath ſome affinity with the former, for if ſervants do not readily obey their Maſters they cannot honour them, they rather vilifie them, and expoſe them to contempt and diſgrace; there are many Scripture texts that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to confirme this truth: <hi>Servants be obedient to your Maſters according to the fleſh,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62199:103"/>
Eph.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Servants obey in all things your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters according to the fleſh, Col</hi> 3.22. <hi>Exhort ſervants</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) to be obedient to their Maſters in all things, not anſwering againe, Tit.</hi> 2.9. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth further preſſe this duty, <hi>Servants</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be ſubject to your Maſters with all feare, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. From all theſe places you may ſee this duty hath the Word of God for its foundation. The Centurion which we read of in the Goſpell had choice ſervants for their readineſſe to obey him, for he tels Chriſt, that if he bid one go, he went, and if another come, he came, and if he bid his ſervant do this, he did it; we muſt not doubt of the truth of what he ſaid, though he ſpake thoſe things to illuſtrate and ſet forth the power of Chriſt over all ſickneſſes and all things; for he doth acknowledge that that ſickneſſe that had arreſted his ſervant was the ſervant of Chriſt, &amp; that as it did afflict his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant when Chriſt commanded it ſo to do, ſo it muſt leave his ſervant and depart when Chriſt ſhould require the ſame, <hi>Mat</hi> 8.8 9. It were much to be wiſh'd that every Maſter had ſuch a ſervant, or ſuch ſervants as this Centurion had, there would be more quietneſſe in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and better ſucceſſe in all their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than now there is. But many ſervants in our times will go and come at their owne pleaſures, and do what is good in their owne eyes: Their Maſters muſt be ſubject to them, and not they to their Maſters; but ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62199:104"/>
will be the greateſt loſers at laſt; Marke what the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſoules as they that muſt give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not with griefe, for that is unprofitable to you, Heb.</hi> 13.17. which is an exhortation in generall, yet it concernes ſervants in ſpeciall. Servants muſt not do any thing contrary to their Maſters minds, though they give no particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the contrary. <hi>Eliſha</hi> did not command his ſervant <hi>Gehazi</hi> not to go after <hi>Naaman</hi> to receive a gratuity, yet he went and did receive a Talent of Silver and two changes of rayment of him; but he could not crack of his profit (as we ſay) for he had the plague of Leproſie with them into the bargaine, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27. Can any man with any ſhew of reaſon conceive that this example of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in <hi>Gehazi</hi> to his Maſter, and of the ſevere hand of God on him for it doth ſtand upon Record for nothing; <hi>Whatſoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, Rom.</hi> 15.4. And this was written to terrifie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and diſobedient ſervants, whereof the world is full, but gratious ſervants will learne and practice better.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third duty of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note>In the third and laſt place it is the duty of ſervants to their Maſters to ſhew all diligence, fidelity, and faithfulneſſe in the diſcharging their buſineſſes, and anſwering the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and that as in the preſence of God. When the Apoſtle in that place of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62199:104"/>
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 7.5, 9. (which we made uſe of before.) had exhorted ſervants to be obedient to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters according to the fleſh with feare and trembling in ſingleneſſe of heart as to Chriſt; he addes, <hi>Not with eye-ſervice as men pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart,</hi> the very ſame you find in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. In <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Exhort ſervants</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to be obedient to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, not purloyning, but ſhewing all good fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that they may adorne the doctrine of God.</hi> When ſervants ſerve their Maſters not with eye-ſervice, but with all faithfulneſſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſſe of heart with a good conſcience, they alſo ſerve Jeſus Chriſt who will plentifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the ſame, either in temporall, or ſpirituall bleſſings, or in both; he is a bleſſed ſervant who obeyes his Maſters commands chiefly in relation to Gods injunctions; ſuch a one (no doubt) was the ſervant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Father <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> and after to the keeper of the priſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.27. <hi>Chap.</hi> 39.3, <hi>ult.</hi> There be divers waies and meanes by which ſervants muſt ſhew themſelves faithfull to their Maſters and Dames; Firſt, by praying for them. Secondly, by being diligent in the diſpatch of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thirdly, by preſerving their Eſtates, and in helping to encreaſe them. Fourthly, by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to protect their perſons from violence to their power. And fifthly, by labouring to preſerve their reputations, in order whereunto they muſt keep their ſecrets undiſcloſed, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62199:105"/>
their infirmities from being publiſhed. But ſuch ſervants as walke in waies contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it were incomparably better for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Houſholder to have them out than in his Family; and indeed it were far better that ſuch ſervants ſhould lye under the cudgell of a Turkiſh patron than ſet their feet under an honeſt mans Table. Thus we have with much brevity paſt through the duties which ſervants owe unto their Maſters and Dames; Firſt, they muſt labour to honour them. Secondly, they muſt ſubmit to them, and obey them. Thirdly and laſtly, they muſt ſhew all diligence, fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and faithfulneſſe to them, in doing their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and in anſwering the truſt committed to them.</p>

Truly, I do exceedingly like thoſe ſweet expreſſions in the Preface to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Forme of Marriage in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where having affirmed the Eſtate of Marriage to be honourable among all men (which indeed it is) the words following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an Admonition, and run thus; Therefore is not to be enterprized, (that is Marriage) nor

They deſire no ſpirituall gifts to enable them to performe ſpirituall duties. They look not upon any qualifications in the party they deſire to enjoy in ſuch a condition, provided, there be perſon and beauty to ſatisfie their brutiſh luſts; and mony to pleaſe their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous humour, they will marry their hearts and ſoules to a bag of ſilver or gold; theſe anſwer the Proverbe, What hath ſhe, what is ſhe; and ſo they make money to anſwer all things. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes, yet to other ends, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.19 And as for the way and meanes which God hath ſanctified and appointed for men to walke in, and make uſe of to obtaine good wives, and meet helpers, they will not ſet one foot in them; they will not go to God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for direction this way, and for ſucceſſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; they ſcarce know what God is; and for the duty of Prayer, they know not ſo much as the A B C of it; and as for Parents conſent they regard not that, all they deſire is to invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle maids to love them, and enchant their fooliſh affections to anſwer their unreaſonable
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62199:106"/>
deſires; let Parents conſent or not conſent what care they (but for ſome ſiniſter ends, for portion ſake, or to attaine preferment by their favour.) There is an impure generation, who have overſpread the Nation, (yea, and many other parts too,) like the Locuſts in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 10.14. who purpoſely do invent obſcene, laſcivious, ſcurrilous, and filthy ſongs and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, on purpoſe to pollute and poyſon young Virgins and Maids with carnall, fleſhly, and abominable luſts, that ſo they may bring them over to themſelves for uncleane dalliance at preſent, and then make them yield to their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Motions, and run point blanke againſt the conſent of their Parents to beſtow themſelves on them; but poore Creatures, when they thinke they are good wives, they are but filthy Whores, ſo long as Parents conſent is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by means whereof the Common-wealth is filled with abundance of Whores Baſtards, by which meanes alſo it comes to paſſe that Townes and Pariſhes are ſo over-charged with poore that there can ſcarce be an able Family there. And where be they who labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelves in the duties which married perſons are call'd to performe each to other, and both to their Families? And theſe duties to mind (as I have ſaid) before Marriage, that afterward they might practice them?

ſay) to change thy condition (as beforeſaid) and wouldſt thou faine enjoy a meet helper in all conditions God ſhall put thee into, whether proſperity or adverſity? Then let me exhort thee (and be thou exhorted) in the name and feare of God to ſee God going before thee by a cleare Call to enterprize ſo great a buſineſſe, even, in fitting thee for the ſame, as hath been before laid downe; and in particular labour to get an humble ſpirit, and an underſtanding heart to diſcharge all duties to every relation that God ſhall ſet under thee, and that for their good both of body and ſoule, that thou maieſt be a bleſſing to them, and they under God a comfort to thee; labour to propound to thy ſelfe lawfull ends in that thy undertaking, and be ſure walke in warrantable waies, and uſe godly and lawfull meanes to carry on thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires by; and amongſt thoſe meanes ſet down for thy direction, mind well (in a way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) the going to God by Prayer; then uſe double care and diligence to meet with one for thy companion who is of a gracious frame both of heart and life, ſo far as poſſibly can be diſcerned. And for thoſe other qualifications before-mentioned, be ſo far from ſlighting them, that rather on the contrary be unſatisfied in thy thoughts if thou find any one of them wanting: Yet not ſo unſatisfied as to divert thy affections from ſuch a party, becauſe ſome one of them are undiſcerned, and perhaps ſome others a little defective; but if the maine be there, then in the name and feare of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62199:107"/>
great God proceed gradually to put a period to all thy cares, paines, and endeavours that way, and now being married, if thou wouldſt have God ſay amen to all thoſe joyes thy friends and acquaintance wiſh thee, then ſet thy ſelfe the worke that lyeth before thee, namely, thy godly and Chriſtian-like diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all the duty that eſtate cals for from thee, which brings me to the ſecond thing propoſed in this Uſe, that is, to ſpeake a word or two of Inſtruction to thoſe in the Marriage condition. It is a true ſaying, that Marriage is either Merry-age, or Mar-age: But if thou wouldſt have it to thee Merry-age, and not Mar-age, then now labour to walke with God in the conſcientious diſcharge of all the duties that the ſame eſtate ties thee to. Art thou a Husband? Labour to performe thy duties to thy Wife. Art thou a Wife? Labour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all thoſe duties thou oweſt to thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and both of you neglect not any of your duties you are obliged to diſcharge to your Children and Servants. And it alſo concernes you to take care to ſee that your Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> performe their duties to you; which duties of all kinds you muſt mind, and be informed in, becauſe hereby (as you have heard) God is glorified, and both Church and State furthered in tranquillity and happineſſe; for by this means (as before expreſt) you ſhall prevent a whole Catalogue of grievous ſins from being perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated; And ſo ſhall ſave the Miniſters of God a great deale of paines, eaſe their Loines, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62199:108"/>
preſerve their Lungs; And prevent a great deale of trouble to all truly godly Magiſtrates, who dare not beare the ſword in vaine, who had rather praiſe you and all others when they ſee you do that which is good than otherwiſe to be a terrour to you. Beloved, theſe are times look'd upon by many as times of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (And truly, I look upon them as calling for much in that kind.) But let me tell you, that let Miniſters do their duties, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates performe theirs, yet if Governours of Families be remiſs in the diſcharge of what concernes them in their relations in their little Churches, and private Common-wealths, all will come to nothing. I profeſſe the well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and right governing of Families is the eye of the worke; I could wiſh with my ſoule that ſuch as have power to make and conſtitute Laws would lay a very conſiderable Mulct upon all Governours of Families that neglect their duties to their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to inſtruct and reforme them; and that the ſame might not only extend to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but to their perſons too. You have heard before that by this meanes ſoules are ſent to hell by multitudes; ſuch evill perſons as theſe are, what are they but the devils Factors? and their ſin and puniſhment one day (without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) will find them out; but moſt ſad of all men is the condition of ſuch (as even out of conſcience (as they pretend) caſt off the care of the ſoules of ſuch as are under their charge; they ſay, and plead hard for it, that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62199:108"/>
none ought to be reſtrained from ſin by uſe of meanes, all Ordinances publique and private muſt be laid aſide, nay, caſt off with ſcorne and diſdaine; and men and women, they ſay, muſt wait for revelations from heaven; ſure they have had revelations from hell for their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction herein, but from heaven they ſhall never have any, unleſſe it be in the demonſtration of the wrath of God if they perſiſt impenitently; and for Family diſcipline there muſt be none, let their Children Sweare, Lye, profane the Sabbaths, or run in any vile way, (provided they call not their Parents and Maſters vile He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and abominable Schiſmaticks, and offer to prove them ſuch from the Word of God,) all is well; for they ſay, they can put no grace into their hearts, but God will (if they belong to him) in due time. Oh what tongue can tell, or what heart can think what will be the portion of theſe men without Gods infinite mercy in converting and reforming them. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, contrary to intention, when we firſt entred upon this Uſe, we have made this digreſſion, it ſhould have been a part of the other Uſe, but being then omitted I was loath to let it wholly paſſe. You may be pleaſed to remember, that but even now I told you that were Governors of Families, that if you did conſcientiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties which you owe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you might hereby glorifie God, and the tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of Church and Common-wealth would hereby be furthered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in the laſt place, from hence you may conclude, (that as you
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62199:109"/>
glorifie God by this means, and do good unto his poore Church on Earth by the encreaſing and purging the members thereof,) that through the Lords free Grace in Chriſt you are Members of the Church of Chriſt here Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and ſhall be of the Church Triumphant in the higheſt Heavens, There to enjoy the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of happineſſe at the right hand of Chriſt, and all glorious and bleſſed Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, and with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bleſſed Angels and Saints, even <hi>the ſoules of juſt men made perfect,</hi> even for ever and ever. <hi>O my ſoule praiſe thou the Lord; praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>
